start:
 - consider revisiting your jargon definitions throughout the talk. Some listeners may have forgotten what they mean

stop:
 - If you misspeak, just restate what you're trying to say without pausing --- I guarantee nobody will notice.

continue:
 - describing what you're going to do before you start the talk
 - giving an overview slide
 - defining jargon in advance
 - delivering the information slowly and methodically, without speaking too quickly. You have a great presentation demeanor!

comments:
 - can you have a signal that is periodic, but not deterministic? My thought is that quasi-periodic signals have stochastic variations about a primary signal source, but those may be not strictly periodic by definition
