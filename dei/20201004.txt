I haven't been making my voice heard in most of these conversations, but I resonate with all of Yiqing's statements so far. 

Understand that these opinions aren't just hers and mine --- from the conversations we've had with other graduate students, they feel (broadly) the same way about this specific issue that led to the discussion last week.

Please know that this kind of discussion is exhausting --- please be considerate, empathetic, and understand how hard it is to participate in a back-and-forth when you're trying to be heard. 

As scientists we often think that it's always okay to ask questions, but this has the effect of draining the energy of the person you're asking questions of, especially if they've already been struggling to get their message to be acknowledged.

We have a lot of work to be done, both inside and outside this group. By listening to and believing each other, we can minimize the internal effort and focus our work on the larger department.




What risk is there for pushing for change harder than we currently are?






We need to be the proponents of targeted change. Resisting change within the committee serves no purpose --- we will already feel this resistance when we bring these issues to the department. What is the harm...?

Acknowledge your privilege as faculty members and staff: 
Why do you feel like things are going well, when others have made it clear that that hasn't been their experience? 

Why are you comfortable? One function of this committee is to make all of us feel uncomfortable as we acknowledge difficult issues.
