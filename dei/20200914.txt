Mengyao: Students stuck outside the country are having difficulty with their studies (Chung, Alejandro)
Yiqing: Alejandro is not getting paid, has to work full time
Mengyao: Feb 1st - Ban on travel from China, use third country as proxy? But after global breakout, borders were closed. Embassies and consulates are closed. Can't even apply for a visa.
  First available date for him to get an appointment is several months from now
  Cambodia is open to Chinese citizens - business Visa, stay for 14 days, visa appointment (very hard to get)
  Expensive flights and hotels, nucleic COVID tests (out of pocket)

Ed: what can the department do to help?

Mengyao: Financial support would be great
  Check in with students stuck overseas

Barbara: Since Alejandro wasn't employed prior to the border closing, he can't work in the country until he has a visa
  It's law that UVA can't hire someone without a visa

Ed:
