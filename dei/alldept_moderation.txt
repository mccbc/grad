I am responsible for asking those questions at the end of each section.


UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
====================

This is a long shot, but could requests be sent to the Seven Society for help with dire situations? 

On the topic of helping the international students with funding, maybe we could set up a crowd fund for them if we canâ€™t access any university support 

In reference to department climate subcommittee: could the funds available to hire a consultant instead be used to provide financial support to the international students that have experienced hardship, like Mengyao, Alejandro, and Cheng?
