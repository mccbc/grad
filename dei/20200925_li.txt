Meeting with Li to discuss TA grievances

This semester specifically, the TA work is unfairly distributed between the 9 TAs.
   - I attempted to make the assignments as fair as possible, but it's obvious that professors cannot accurately report the number of TAs they truly need.

Li: 
1210: first quiz. Asked TA to grade this quiz --- 110 students. Most questions are automatically graded. Only 5 questions graded by the TA. Can definitely see that the work comes in in a big spike. 

Balance across the board for different students? Perhaps assign 4 TAs to 1230, have each of them grade for a section of 1210 as well. 

If students want to volunteer to switch around, that would be best. 


Document the kind of work for each class, don't depend on the professors to report how much work. Have the student document the number of hours they actually spend (top secret).


Is TA funding given to the department under the assumption that the TAs are actually working 20 hours?
 - Yes. Tricky because we don't want to audit and find out we don't need as many TAs.

We want to get a consistent reading on how much work is required by each class. Need a basis to allocate around. 

THIS SEMESTER: Need to make sure Jack and Korash are not overworked. Could ask for volunteers to step up to help them out if they feel like their assignments are less intense. 


   - The first years feel that their time is going solely into classes and TA work, and not leaving enough time for research. They feel the department is not up front about what the expectations are for allocation of time
         - For example, they were told their day-to-day would be heavily research focused, but that is not the case.

LI: Phil's class. The vast majority is also taking radio. Three classes? 


 > Graduate handbook should be reworked. Needs to be honest about the distribution of effort, to not give first years false pretenses / imposter syndrome about how much research they are able to do in their first semesters.



TA assignments are inherently unequal between different classes, and can't really be made equal. 2130 is always going to be a massive time sink, and with only 9 TA lines it is impossible to fairly distribute that effort. 


 > We should make an effort to incorporate more undergraduate TAs or undergraduate graders. 

LI:
A matter of funding and finding a grader. In terms of funding --- there is some money for an undergraduate grader. We can ask Barbara to get funding for them. Time requirement for the grader - contact instructor, find out how many hours needed. Ask Barbara, copy Craig, to request a grader for X hours per week. Hourly wage is $12-15 / hr. Probably doable. 

ME: Work out with Borja / Korash the hourlies for Borja's. There's no minimum to justify the need for an ungrad. 



 - I need detailed funding information about the possibility of hiring undergraduate graders. This would allow us to offload some of the grading to an undergrad paid hourly, allowing a single grad TA to cover multiple sections of 1210, for example. Then, we could allocate plenty of grad TAs to important observation classes like 1230. 

 - Need to make Korash a full-time 1230 TA. Hire an undergrad grader to help cover 1220 hourly, give that assigment to someone else.

Longer term --- what specific steps need to be taken in order to increase the number of TA lines? It doesn't matter if this won't actually happen for 2 more years: unless enrollment decreases significantly over time, we have a clear need for additional TAs.

If we find that all of our students are spending more than 20 hours to do the work that is assigned, we can go to GSAS and ask for an additional line. 
If we have a good sense of how people distribute their time between assignments, then the instructors themselves can change their exams / short answer questions to adapt.
