second year grad student
Younger representative -- hope to be able to carry these actions forward into the coming years


Why was this committee formed?

 - In response to letters. Requested committee's formation, 



Some feel like our hands are tied and there's nothing that we can do --- want to change that mentality. Challenge the higher authority.

 What can we be doing to help uninterested parties participate in DEI issues?



Consultant: 

There's no framework in academia for race / gender issues. Our scientific content doesn't contain humanitarian studies.

The culture of science --- we don't change things about the system. Why can't we change it, though?

What are the department demographics?




The work that the consultant does:
  People often use the one-time workshops as a checkmark. Doesn't work for change over time.
  Curriculum model --- facilitated discussions, interactive workshops over the course of a semester or academic year. One engagement per month
  Long term consulting: once a month / every two weeks. A week or two after DEI meeting, collect & ask questions and consultants will answer.
    Examples:

    Admissions process is not equitable. Put together a team that are points of contact. Consultants would assess the admissions process from top to bottom. Takes a period of 2 to 3 months with frequent meetings with the points of contact. Where is there room for bias?
 
   Climate assessment. Sit down and listen to what the issues are. Implement programming to bridge the gap between where the department is and where we want it to be. Establish continuity after the consultants go --- it is sustainable. Doesn't rely on exploitation of minority effort.


best thing to do first: climate assessment
  sets up structure, creating a longer term partnership where cultural shifts are set on the right path
  Need to identify the issues first.
