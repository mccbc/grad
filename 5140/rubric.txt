Tasks:

1. 10 pts available

10  Student has derived/used the correct expression for v_rot
 7  Student attempted a derivation but got it wrong
 0  Derivation is not included in writing or in code

2. 10 pts available

10  Student has derived/used the correct expression for Prot
 7  Student has attempted a derivation but got it wrong
 0  Derivation is not included in writing or in code

3. 80 pts available

a. Calculate the rotational period of each star in the dataset (30 pts)

30  Student correctly matches the catalog and derives Prot with errors
20  Student gets Prot but does not track uncertainties
15  Code does not successfully calculate Prot, but an attempt is made
 0  No submission

b. Make a plot showing this rotational period as a function of effective temperature (40 pts)

40  Plot shows both sets of errorbars and student has made appropriate coding decisions to produce a sensible plot
35  Plot shows only one set of errorbars, either in x direction or y direction
30  Plot has no error bars
20  Plot does not show the correct data

c. Address what kinds of stars show increased rotational velocities (5 pts)
d. Fit a function to the data (5 pts)
