mra5be@virginia.edu,,Abruzzo,Massimo,"(a) Yes- length contraction applies to the door operator's perspective of the space truck, where the space truck moving very close to the speed of light contracts along the direction it is moving in. This works because the door operator is in an inertial frame and special relativity applies.

(b) No- from the point of view of the truck driver, the length of the truck is not changing, as relativity does not apply within one's individual reference frame. To the truck driver, the truck is not contracting in the direction it is moving, and thus is too long to pass through the scanning station.

(c) Since the truck driver is in his own reference frame moving at close to the speed of light, the truck driver visualizes the operator to be contracting along the direction the operator moves across the truck driver's point of view relative to the truck driver. On the other hand, the operator sees the truck driver and the truck moving at close to the speed of light, and thus the operator sees the truck contract along the direction of its movement. Therefore, the operator sees the truck contract, while the truck driver does not because he is in the reference frame of the moving space truck. ","(a) Michelson and Morley's experiment. They were able to use a beam splitter and mirrors to prove that the speed of light is constant after noticing the time for the light to reach the moving mirror was larger than the time it took for light to reach the stationary mirror. 



(b) Acceleration- once acceleration occurs, an observer is no longer in their original reference frame before they started accelerating. Once acceleration occurs, special relativity can no longer apply. 



(c) The speed of light is measured to be the same by all observers, and all laws of physics apply to all reference frames.

ja6ue@virginia.edu,ja6ue,Aceron,Justin,"a. Yes, the truck can fit into the station from the operator's perspective due to length contraction. Since the truck's movement is in the same direction and not perpendicular, it appears shorter

aa7vd@virginia.edu,aa7vd,Aggarwal,Akshet,"a) Yes, the truck can fit inside the station from the door operator’s perspective due to the length contraction of the truck as experienced by the door operator. As the truck is travelling close to light’s speed relative to the door man, he will perceive the truck’s length to shorten from 10m to 9m due to the concept of length contraction



b)No, because the truck driver is inside the truck and the truck isn’t moving relative to the driver. Thus, the length of the truck will always remain 10m for the driver as he will not see any length contraction.



c)Relativity states that the laws of physics will remain the same for both observers in different inertial frames. So, they will agree on the order of events but might on agree on the simultaneity of events.



","a)Einstein determined that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, and that the speed of light in a vacuum was independent of the motion of all observers. The michelson-Morley experiment proved this result



b)Einstein’s theory of relativity applies to the inertial frames. The difference between an inertial and non-inertial frame is that the inertial frame is always corresponding to an observer that experiences no acceleration at all. Any acceleration makes the frame non-inertial

A). yes, the truck can fit in the station from the operator's perspective because length contraction of moving objects allows the truck to apparel shorter so it will fit in the station. 



B.) No, the truck cannot fit in the station from the driver's perspective because in the driver's frame the truck will always be 10 m and the station will always be 9 m.



C.) Relatively allows them to hold different views of the length of the truck because of time dilation and length contraction.  Since time runs more slowly from the perspective of the driver compared to the operator, they can have different views on the length of time between 2 points.  

","A.) Einstein used the results from the Michelson and Morley experiment which their results said that the speed of light is constant independent of the earth's motion.

b) No it can not, since we have not learned about any phenomenon such as length.... stretching? where the length of an object would appear longer than it actually is, the length of the truck must be greater than or equal to 10m (accounting for the fact that the length may be biased depending on who measured it) so it will not be able to fit in a 9m station regardless of how it appears.



c) As explained above, due to relativity and high velocities, the door operator will see the truck and the truck driver as smaller than they actually are.

tb8fu@virginia.edu,,Baird,Tristan,"a) Yes, the truck can fit inside the station from the door operator's perspective, since the truck's length will appear to contract to a great degree along its direction of motion due to it's high velocity.



b) No, from the truck's perspective it is motionless and the scanning station is moving towards it at nearly the speed of light. Thus, the 9m scanning station will contract its length to < 9m from the truck's perspective and it would be impossible for its 10m length to fit inside, even for an instant.



c) Relative simultaneity allows us to resolve this apparent paradox. Since the ends of the truck are at two different locations, observers in different reference frames do not have to agree on the relative simultaneity of events (i.e. if both ends of the truck are inside the scanning station at the same time) since simultaneity is observer dependent by the theory of special relativity.

dkb7bt@virginia.edu,,Bassford,Dana,"Yes the truck would be able to fit in the perspective of the door operator. The reason for this is that when you are traveling at the speed of light  length contractions occur which means things appear smaller than they would be if they were still. So if the driver is traveling extremely fast his 10m long truck would appear to be contracted to the operator and for an instant fit into the 9m long scanning station



The truck would not be able to fit from the drivers perspective because in his reference frame he is not moving and thus the truck is its same length



They are allowed to have different views because the ends of the truck are at different locations so therefore they do not have to agree because of the fact that simultaneity is observer-dependent

ab8dv@virginia.edu,643692555,Beatrice,Anna,"(A) From the door operator’s perspective, the truck can fit inside the station because of a length contraction. It would make the moving object appear shorter, so the closer to the speed of light the truck moves, the shorter it becomes in the operator’s frame. 



(B) From the truck driver’s perspective, the truck cannot fit inside the station because in his frame the truck is 10 meters long and the scanning station is 9 meters long which will always be less. 



(C) Because the front/back of the truck are at different locations, the driver and the operator do not have to agree that the ends of the truck are simultaneously within the scanner.

They rotated their apparatus so there was no addition or subtraction with Earth’s velocity. This meant that the speed of light was constant.

jeb3be@virginia.edu,,Bernstein,Joel,"a. From the door operator’s perspective, the truck can fit in the doors. The Lorentz factor is high enough at close to the speed of light that the length of the truck from a stationary perspective will be less than 9m and will be able to fit in the garage.

b.	The truck will not be able to fit from the driver’s perspective. For the driver, the truck is 10m long and remains that way. To him, the garage is moving very fast relative to him, so its length will be contracted. Since the garage is already shorter than the truck, it’s safe to say from his perspective the truck will never be fully inside the garage.

c.	Relativity tells us that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. This remains true for the driver and door operator, and the speed of light remains constant for both. However, due to their high difference in speeds, the light (and thus time, since light is the fastest possible speed) takes different amounts of time to reach each observer. Each observer thinks the other’s clock runs slow in the same way that each sees the other’s length as shorter than they each believe their own is. 

","

a.	The experimental result that motivated Einstein was the finding that the speed of light is a constant to all observers. This was found by Michelson and Morley, who used a circular rotating contraption with light travelling from a central mirror back to receptors on the end of the edge to show that the light took the same amount of time to get to each mirror despite the rotation. 

b.	An inertial frame does not experience acceleration, so it must be travelling at a constant velocity. A stationary person is an inertial observer while a someone going 0-60 in a car is not.

c.	The speed of light is measured to be the same by all observers and the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.

amb4nc@virginia.edu,Chelseafc11,Bertone,Alex,"a) Yes, from the door operator's perspective, assuming the space truck is moving very close to the speed of light, length contraction will allow the truck to fit inside the station from the door operator's perspective because the length of the truck would look smaller than the 10m to the station operator and therefore could fit inside the smaller station.  



b) No the truck wouldn't be able to fit in the station from the truck driver's perspective because length contraction, in this case, would apply to the station (making it less than 9m long) and from the driver's perspective, the truck would still be 10 m and would therefore be longer than the perceived station length due to length contraction and wouldn't be able to fit. 



c) Special relativity has to do with the observer's perspective. From the door operator's perspective, the truck is moving relative to him which would result in length contraction of the truck from the operator's persepctive. On the other hand, from the truck driver's persepctive, the station is moving relative to him. Therefore, the legnth contraction would apply to the station. Additionally, since the ends of the truck are not in the same location, the truck driver and station operator do not have to agree that the ends of the truck were simultaneously inside the station because simultaneity is observer dependent. ","a) The experimental result that motivated Einstein's theory is that light travels at a constant speed for all observers. The experiment that first found this result was the Michelson-Morley experiment. 



b) The key property that distinguishes an inertial frame from a non-inertial frame is whether or not the frame of reference is accelerating. If the observer's frame of reference is moving at a constant velocity, and therefore not accelerating, it would be an inertial reference frame. Comparatively, if the observer's frame of reference is not moving at a constant velocity and is accelerating, it would not be an inertial frame.

jhb9mp@virginia.edu,jhb9mp,Blue,Josh,"a) Yes, the truck will be able to fit in the station from door operator's perspective if the truck is moving close to the speed of light. Length contraction occurs for the observer in an inertial frame (the door operator) and the observer perceives objects moving relative them to be shorter than the same object at rest. 



b) No, the truck will not fit inside the station from the driver's perspective. Because the truck driver is in his own inertial frame (the moving truck), he/she does not perceive a difference in the length of his/her truck.



c) Relativity implies that observers in relative motion disagree about the length of an object in motion. This explains why from the perspective of the door operator, the truck can fit in the station. From the operator's perspective, the truck's length is contracted because the truck is in motion at a velocity close to the speed of light relative to the operator. However, from the driver's perspective, the station (and the operator) are in motion relative to him/her and therefore, the station will appear even shorter, which would prevent the truck from fitting.

(b) No, because in the truck driver’s perspective the space truck is still 10 m and the station is always 9 m or less since the truck is moving near the speed of light.

(c) Relativity allows you to reconcile the views of the door operator and truck driver because the ends of the truck are at different locations, so they do not have to agree that the ends of the space truck fit inside the station because simultaneity is observer dependent.

cvc2mme@virginia.edu,,Calfee,Carley,"a: From the perspective of the door operator, who is at a different location that the truck driver and is thus able to observe the truck moving from a different reference frame, it is possible that the truck can fit inside of the station. Due to length contraction, moving objects traveling at velocities close to the speed of light appear shorter than the same object would at rest, meaning it could fit inside the station.



b: From the truck driver's perspective, the truck cannot fit inside the station since length contraction only takes place from an outside observer's location at a different reference frame. From the truck driver's reference frame, his length and the length of the station do not change, meaning that he cannot fit inside.



c: According to relativity, observers from different reference frames do not have to agree on the simultaneity of events since simultaneity is observer dependent. Therefore, the door operator and truck driver do not have to agree on whether or not the truck actually fit within the station since both events are true from their own reference frame.","a: The Michelson and Morley experiment motivated Einstein's theory.

jpc4ax@virginia.edu,628466737,Carlton,John,"A)	The truck can fit inside the station from the door operator’s perspective.  This is because an object moving at a large fraction of the speed of light experiences length contraction, meaning that if the truck moves fast enough it will be shortened enough to fit within the station for an instant.

B)	The truck cannot fit within the station from the truck driver’s perspective.  This is because, from the driver’s point of view, he and the truck are stationary while the station moves past them at a large fraction of the speed of light.  This will cause the station to experience length contraction that makes it shorter than 9 m long, with the truck being 10 m long.

C)	The truck driver and the door operator have different views of whether or not the truck fits because they are in different inertial frames.  Both view themselves as stationary and the other as moving past them with a large velocity.  This means that they view the lengths of the passing object as contracted.  For the door operator, this means the truck will be contracted enough to fit within the station.  For the truck driver, it means that the station will be contracted, making it even shorter than it was before so that it is impossible for the truck to fit.

","A)	The experimental result that motivated Einstein was that of the Michelson-Morley experiment: that the speed of light is constant.  He was further motivated by Fitzgerald and Lorentz’s proposal that the contraction of moving bodies along their direction of motion would help explain this

B)	An inertial frame has no acceleration.

clc6hu@virginia.edu,,Carrington,Charlie,"From the door operator's perspective, the truck can fit inside the station. The operator is an inertial observer with no acceleration, and the truck moving at light speed towards him would thus undergo the effects of time dilation and length contraction. The faster moving an object, the shorter the perceived length of that object from the perspective of the observer. The Lorenz factor is greater than 1, and significant as the space truck is traveling at close to the speed of light, meaning the 10m truck seems to be smaller than the 9m station from the perspective of the operator. The station's length does not contract from the operator's perspective as it is his frame of reference. From the driver's perspective, the station is moving at close to light speed towards him. The same length contraction effects apply here so the station would seem to be smaller than 9m from the perspective of the truck driver. His vehicle would still be 10m from his perspective as that is his frame of reference, so he would definitely think the truck couldn't fit. This is also assuming the truck driver drives at a constant speed. Relativity allows for these views to reconcile because while it shows that all observers must agree with the order of casually connected events and the laws of physics, the time and length of a person or object respectively is not something observers must agree on. For example, both the operator and the truck driver would have thought the other's time was running slow, when the difference is actually in their frame of reference.

 ",The Michaelson and Morey Experiment showed the experimental result of the speed of light being constant and motivated Einstein's theory.

Yes, from the standpoint of the door operator, the length of a moving object contracts, and the truck is moving near the speed of light, making the contraction significant. At a high enough relative velocity, the length of the truck will appear short enough to fit inside the scanning station.

b)

No, again, length contraction makes moving objects relative to an inertial frame appear shorter. This means that to the truck driver, the scanning station appears shorter than 9 m for a 10 m truck, so it will never appear to fit inside for them.

c) 

Due to relativity of simultaneity two different inertial observers do not have to agree whether two events in different locations happen at the same time, since this depends on their inertial frame. Therefore, since the front and back ends of the truck are not in the same place, the truck driver and door operator don’t have to agree whether or not the front and back were inside the scanning station at the same time.

","(a) What experimental result motivated Einstein’s theory and what experiment first found this result?

Michelson and Morley’s interferometer experiment, where they found that there was no change in light signal due to constructive or destructive interference when they rotated the interferometer (thus meaning that there was no addition of earth’s velocity to the velocity of light) This meant that the speed of light was constant. 

(b) Einstein’s theory applies to inertial frames or inertial observers.  What key property distinguishes an inertial frame from a non-inertial frame?

An inertial frame is at a constant velocity, basically, there is no net force acting on it.

(c) Einstein formulated his theory from two postulates.  What are these two postulates?

The speed of light is measured to be the same by all observers.

In all inertial reference frames, the laws of physics are the same.

cdc7ck@virginia.edu,,Childs,Conner,"(a) Yes. The entire truck can fit inside the scanning station from the perspective of the door operator because of Length Contraction. Which states that from the outsider’s perspective, things appear smaller when they are moving. Especially since the truck is moving near the speed of light, then it will be even smaller (because the faster you go, the more contract you become).

(b) No. From the truck driver’s frame, the truck is 10 m long and the scanner is only 9 m long. Since the driver is also moving close to the speed of light (the same frame as the truck), he does not see the truck contract.

(c) They have different views because of special relativity, so from the perspective of the door operator, there is a moment that the entire truck will fit inside the scanner. However, from the driver’s perspective, this is impossible because he is in the same frame as the truck that is moving near the speed of light. Simultaneity is observer dependent, so they have different perspectives here which means both are correct from their own point of view.

","(a) The experimental result was that there is a constant speed of light. It was the Michelson and Morley experiments where they discovered the constant speed of light. They found no variation of the signal they were testing when the device rotated, so they gathered that it was a constant speed. Einstein was motivated by this experiment.

(b) The main property of inertial frames is that there is a zero net force acting on it and it does not accelerate. We saw this in the twin paradox example, that the twin who traveled to a star and back accelerated when she stopped and turned around, therefore her frame was not inertial. Therefore, an inertial frame is one that does not accelerate or has a zero net force acting on it.

(c) The Theory of Special Relativity has two postulates. The first states that the speed of light is the same for all observers no matter what or where it is being observed. The second states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.

samanthacynn@yahoo.com,,Cynn,Samantha,"A. The space truck can fit inside the station from the door operator's perspective. Despite the fact that the space truck is one meter longer than the scanning station, observers perceive moving objects to be contracted, which causes them to appear shorter. Because the truck is moving close to the speed of light, the truck becomes shorter in the door operator's frame.



B. From the truck driver's perspective, the truck cannot fit inside the station. Observers are always stationary and do not move in their own frame; as a result, they do not perceive relativistic effects on themselves. Thus, the truck driver always perceives the truck to be 10 meters and the station to be shorter than the truck in his frame.



C. Even though the door operator and the truck driver have different perspectives about whether the truck can fit inside the station, relativity allows us to reconcile these two views in a way that follows the laws of physics, which all observers must agree on. From the door operator's perspective, the length contraction he perceives makes it possible for the entire truck to be inside the station, because the truck becomes shorter in his frame. The truck driver's frame, on the other hand, states that the truck cannot fully fit inside the station. However, because the simultaneity of spatially separated events is relative, the door operator and truck driver do not have to agree that the front and the back of the truck were simultaneously inside the station, since the front and back of the truck are not in the same location.","A. The experimental result that motivated Einstein's theory of special relativity came from the Michelson and Morley experiment conducted in 1887. This experiment found no variation in the signal as the paths in their interferometer device changed orientation relative to the Earth's motion through the aether. This showed that there was no addition or subtraction with Earth's velocity through the aether, which was inconsistent with either view of light as a wave or a particle.



B. An inertial frame is a frame corresponding to an observer that experiences no acceleration and is therefore at a constant (or zero) velocity. Non-inertial frames are any frames that experience some amount of acceleration. Thus, the key property that distinguishes the two is acceleration.

b)	No, from the driver’s perspective the truck is always 10 m long, but the scanning station is 9 m or less long, given that the station is moving relative to the truck driver and the length is in the direction of its relative motion. Because he shares inertial frame with the truck, the truck’s length is not contracted for him

sed8mtv@virginia.edu,,Davis,Sabiya,"a)	From the door operator’s perspective, yes, the space truck can fit into the 9m long scanning station because of the length contraction making the truck appear smaller, thus small enough to fit into the doors in time.

ard8jqr@virginia.edu,,Dreyer,Alize,"a. From the perspective of the door operator, the truck can fit inside the station because of length contraction. When an object (in this case the space truck) is moving close to the speed of light, observers perceive its length to contract and so it can fit into the station.



b. From the truck driver's perspective, the station is whose length is contracting and that the station is what is moving close to the speed of light, so the station would get shorter and the truck cannot fit inside it.



c. According to special relativity, events do not have to be simultaneous to different observers in different locations. Since the two ends of the truck are in different locations, this case applies to this situation. The truck driver thinks that the truck's ends cannot fit at the same time into the station, but the door operator thinks that both ends of the truck fit inside the station at the same time.","a. Einstein's theory includes that the speed of light is constant and time and space are relative, which was the opposite of common knowledge prior to Einstein. The Michelson-Morely experiment suggested that the speed of light is constant and is not affected by the movement of the Earth through what they thought was the ""aether."" Although they assumed that their experiment had a mistake, Einstein pushed these ideas further and decided that for it to make sense of this, light's speed must be a constant. This influenced his theory of special relativity that has the speed of light being a constant as one of its main ideas.



b. An inertial frame is a type of reference frame. It is a frame that is moving at a constant velocity without acceleration, so it does not change direction or lower or increase its speed. A non-inertial frame is any frame in which the observers are accelerating.



c. Einstein's special relativity theory has two postulates: 1) the speed of light is measured to be the same by all observers, and 2) the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames (doesn't apply to acceleration reference frames).",2,2,2,0,0,3,1,2,0,2,1,2,1,0,1,3,2,2,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,2020-09-25 13:06:08 -0400,2020-09-25 13:11:47 -0400,2020-09-25 13:12:08 -0400,2020-09-25 13:12:35 -0400,2020-09-25 13:12:47 -0400,2020-09-25 13:13:11 -0400,2020-09-25 13:16:10 -0400,2020-09-25 13:17:08 -0400,2020-09-25 13:20:01 -0400,2020-09-25 13:23:54 -0400,2020-09-25 13:25:59 -0400,2020-09-25 13:32:48 -0400,2020-09-25 13:33:52 -0400,2020-09-25 13:34:11 -0400,2020-09-25 13:35:04 -0400,2020-09-25 13:35:45 -0400,2020-09-25 13:36:09 -0400,2020-09-25 13:36:33 -0400,2020-09-25 13:37:03 -0400,2020-09-25 13:37:38 -0400,2020-09-25 13:37:52 -0400,2020-09-25 13:39:45 -0400

b) From the truck driver's perspective, the truck will not fit. From his perspective, the truck will always be 10m and the station will be 9m. As the trucks approaches the speed of light, the station will actually appear even smaller than 10m.



c) The door operator and truck driver will have different views about whether the truck will fit. From the standpoint of the station, there is a time when the truck could fit because of length contradiction. On the other hand, the truck driver will never have the illusion of the truck fitting.

zf2fn@virginia.edu,,Faisal,Zainab,"a) From the door operator’s perspective, the space truck can fit inside the station with both doors closed. This is possible due to length contraction which states that moving objects appear to be shorter along their direction of motion than when they are at rest. Since the door operator is the observer, he will perceive the space truck to contract in length which allows it to fit inside the station. 



b) From the truck driver’s perspective, the truck will not fit inside the station because the truck driver is static in his own frame. In his own frame, the truck will not contract in length and it will not be able to fit inside the space station with both doors closed. 



c) Relativity can reconcile the different views between the door operator and truck driver since they are both in different frames. They do not have to agree that the truck was able to fully fit into the station with both ends of the truck simultaneously inside since the front end of the truck and the back end are at different locations and simultaneity is observer-dependent. Length contraction will only allow the observer (door operator in this case) to perceive the truck to be shorter. Since the truck driver is in his own frame, he will not perceive this relativistic effect and he will not agree with the door operator.","a) The experimental result was that the speed of light was measured as constant. This was first found by the Michaelson and Morely experiment in which they found no variation in their signal as they rotated their apparatus. 



b) Inertial frames correspond to an observer with no acceleration (constant velocity). An inertial frame is only an inertial frame if it moves with constant velocity. Observers in inertial frames may not agree on the description of motion but can agree that laws of physics (ex: F=ma) are obeyed.

sgf2rr@virginia.edu,,Fertig,Seth,"a) yes. Because the approaching space truck will appear to be shortened by it speed (roughly 130 million m/s to appear to be 9 meters long).

b) no. Because the scanning station is moving at the same relative speed as the space truck in the truck's frame, in the opposing direction. And so, the scanning station will appear to be shortened at the same rate as the space truck.

c) Relativity allows us to reconcile this because observers in different frames don't have to agree on the simultaneity of events. The door operator will see a shortened space truck, both doors shut at the same instant, then reopen and allow the truck to exit. To the truck driver, though, the doors don't close at the same time. And so, while the truck is not fully within the station, the front door will appear to be open, while the rear is shut. The rear door opens, the truck moves enough to allow the front door to close, the truck exits, and the front door opens.","a) The result of a Michelson and Morley experiment found that the speed of light was constant, which was inconsistent with both wave and particle theory, and motivated Einstein to solve this problem.

b)No, from the frame of the drivers perspective he always sees the door as 9 meters long and his truck as 10 meters long.

c)Relativity allows two different observes in different reference frames to disagree over whether two events are simultaneous.

cmf8hv@virginia.edu,,Fox,Caroline,"a.) If the space truck moves very close to the speed of light, then from the door operator's perspective, it would be able to fit inside the station. This is due to the phenomenon of length contraction, in which moving objects appear shorter to the observer. The effects are negligible under normal circumstances, but the phenomenon is heightened and more evident at speeds close to the speed of light. 

b.) From the driver's perspective, however, the truck cannot fit inside the station. This is because the driver is an inertial observer within his own frame. The driver himself is not experiencing acceleration relative to the truck--he is part of this frame.

mg4ccz@virginia.edu,,Ganesan,Mahin,"a) From the operator's perspective, the truck can fit inside the station. Because of the concept of length contraction, the door operator can perceive the truck that is moving close to the speed of light to be shorter than the truck would be at rest. 



b) The truck cannot fit in the station from the driver's perspective. Based on the reference frame of the driver, the truck and the scanning station will not have their lengths changed because in his frame, he is at rest, meaning that length contraction does not apply in his frame.



c) According to relativity, it is normal for the two to have differing views about whether the truck fits. Based on the operator's view, the truck should not fit and based on the driver's view, it should. So, based on their own reference frames, they are both correct in their views.

ecg6wm@virginia.edu,,Gardiner,Emiko,"a) Yes, it is possible for the space truck to fit inside the station doors from the door operator’s perspective because the truck (moving relative to the door operator) will appear contracted, with a length <10m. Meanwhile, the scanning station is not moving relative to the door operator, so will appear as 9m. Thus, if the truck moves fast enough it can seem <9m to the operator.



b) No, from the truck driver’s perspective the truck is always 10m (since it is not moving relative to the truck driver). The station will be moving close to the speed of light relative to the truck and thus appear contracted, <9m. So, the 10m truck cannot fit within the <9m station.



c) According to special relativity, inertial observers need not agree on simultaneity/order for objects at different locations.

sbg8vb@virginia.edu,,Glasgow,Samuel,"A. Due to length contraction, from the perspective of the operator, the truck can fully fit inside the station. This is the case because the truck is moving at a large fraction of the speed of light, its length is perceived to be shortened to the door operator. Therefore, it is possible for both ends to be simultaneously inside of the station from the door operator’s perspective.



B. From the truck driver’s perspective, the truck can never fully fit inside of the station. This is because the truck driver is resting in his/her own frame and therefore perceives the truck to have its length of 10m. Additionally, because of length contraction, it is likely the length of the station is contracted to the perspective of the driver, thus making it even more impossible for them to perceive that the truck can fit inside of the station.



C.The views of the door operator and the truck driver can be reconciled by the relativity of simultaneity. The driver believes that the truck can never fully fit in the station, but the operator believes that it can. This is allowed in special relativity because the ends of the truck are not in the exact same location, the operator and driver can have different perception of their location at a given point in time because of the relativity of simultaneity. ","A. The Michelson and Morley experiment found what, at the time, was considered a questionable result: the speed of light is constant. Most other physicists at the time doubted the likelihood of this statement’s truth, but this finding was the kernel of Einstein’s theory of special relativity. 



B. An inertial frame is a frame that is not accelerating, in other words, velocity is constant. An example of an inertial frame could be someone moving at a constant speed on a train going completely straight (an inertial frame on earth). A non-inertial frame is a frame that is being accelerated in some way. A good example of this comes from the “twin paradox.” The twin that goes to a distant planet and returns is not an inertial observer because he/she underwent accelerations of the travel. 



C. The two postulates for Einstein’s theory of special relativity are:

2. No because in the truck driver's frame the truck is always 10 m long, even if the door was approaching him the door would experience length contraction and the truck would not fit either way.

3. Moving lengths are contracted, so since the door operator is not moving relative to the truck driver, their length is not contracted. Conversely, since the truck driver is moving relative to the door operator, the truck's length appears to contract. Length contraction only occurs along the direction of motion, not in transverse directions.","1. Lorentz and Fitzgerald proposed the contraction of moving bodies along the direction of motion after interpreting Michaelson & Morley's experiment which used light, mirrors, and a beam splitter to find the speed of light is constant.

Because length contraction makes observes perceive moving objects to be smaller than they actually are, the door operator perceives the length of the truck to be smaller. Therefore, the door operator believes the truck will fit inside the scanning station from his perspective.



b. For the truck driver, however, the truck will not fit inside the scanning station because, especially since he is travelling close to the speed of light, the scanning station appears even smaller than it actually is. Therefore, the truck driver believes it will not fit into the station.



c. The effects of relativity (time dilation, length contraction) work together to ensure that inertial observers at different velocities can agree on the physics of whatever occurs. ","

a. The result that motivated Einstein’s theory of special relativity was the idea that the speed of light is measured to be the same by all observers. Einstein built his theory around this idea and how it makes sense. The first experiment that confirmed his theory was Michealson and Morley’s experiment that proved the existence of the ether.

jph2ek@virginia.edu,jph2ek,Harrington,Jack,"1) The truck should look like it fits from the door operator's perspective, since observers perceive objects moving at extremely fast speeds to be shortened along their direction of travel. In this case, since the driver is moving into the station, it should look shorter along the length of the station to the operator.

2) The truck driver, being in the same inertial frame as the truck, does not perceive it to be shortened. Therefore, he does not think it can fit in the station, as he thinks it is still 10 m long and the station is only 9 m.

3) Relativity explains that we can perceive things differently depending on the frame of reference we observe something happening in. The truck driver, moving at the same speed as his truck, does not perceive it to be any different than it would standing still.

Due to length contraction from caused by their relative speeds, the operator perceives the truck to contract and become shorter in length than its actual 10m length.  Since the truck is moving at a speed very close to the speed of light towards the station, it would contract a great amount and appear to easily fit the maximum 9m station.



b) No. Similar to how the operator observes the truck to contract, the truck driver would perceive the station to contract as its speed relative to the truck would be close to that of light while the truck perceives itself to be stationary.



c) Special relativity tells us about the concept of length contraction which causes observers to perceive the length of moving objects to contract.  Because this is merely an observational distortion, the observations do not have to agree as they are based on different inertial frames of reference since this effect is purely optical and has no real effect on the actual lengths of the station or the truck.

","a) Einstein was motivated by the experimental results of a constant speed of light as measured by Michelson and Morely.  



b) Einstein’s theory applies to inertial frames which are frames of reference that experience no acceleration (constant velocity).



c) Einstein’s two postulates were that the speed of light is measured by all observers to be the same and that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.

skj5fr@virginia.edu,,Jassal,Simrat,"a)From the door operator's perspective, the truck will fit because the length contraction will make the length appear shorter of a moving object. The closer the truck is traveling to the speed of light, the shorter it will become in the door operator's perspective. 



b)  From the truck driver's perspective the truck is 10 meters long and the scanning station is only 9 meters. So the truck will not be able to fit in the station from his perspective. But if he is traveling close to the speed of light, it will be less. 



c)From the door operator perspective, there is a time when the truck can fit inside the station simultaneously. from the truck driver's point of view it cannot be inside the station simultaneously with both doors closed. But, relativity allows us to reconcile their views because they do not have to agree because simultaneity is observer dependent. Relativity refers to distance, time, and direction. Two different observers in different reference frames do not have to agree on whether events are simultaneous.

","a) In 1905 Einstein published 4 papers: special relativity, mass energy (E=mc^2), Brownian motion, and photoelectric effect. His big idea and theory of realitivity was around the speed of light is same for all observers. He just accepted this as an experimentally verified law of nature. He tried to understand the implications of this postulate.  The Michelson & Morley experiment first found the result Einstein's theory of special relativity. It said that speed of light was Constant and independent of Earth’s motion. They found that the speed of light was constant and thought the experiment was incorrect but could not figure out what was wrong with the experiment.They found no variation in the signal even when they rotated the apparatus to adjust for Earth's velocity through aether. 



b) Inertial frames are a Subset of reference frame. It corresponds to an observer with no acceleration (constant velocity). An inertial frame moves with constant velocity. Observers in inertial frames may not agree on the description of motion but can agree that law of physics are obeyed. Hence, something is an inertial frame if and only if it is moving with constant velocity. For example from lecture, If a train moves at constant speed in a straight line, it is an inertial frame.But,If it is speeding up or moving around a corner it ceases to be an inertial frame. Any acceleration makes a frame non inertial. This is crucial in the twin paradox because one of them ceases to be an inertial frame due to the acceleration!



3) The two postulates of the theory are that the speed of light is measured to be the same by all observers and the law of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. The second postulate only applies to observers in an inertial frame. This is what is 'special' in the special relativity.

b) the key property that distinguishes an inertial frame from a non-inertial frame is acceleration.

gmk3ug@virginia.edu,302250255,Keffer,Griffin,"A. Yes, from the perspective of the operator the truck will fit given length contraction. Length contraction causes moving objects to appear shorter. The closer to the speed of light the object is moving the shorter it will appear. 



B. No, in the truck drivers' frame the truck stays 10 m long, and depending on his speed the station will be 9m or shorter. Given he is traveling at close to the speed of light it will shrink, so he can’t fit. 



C. Relativity can reconcile the driver and operators’ differing views because simultaneity is observer-dependent. Although light travels at the same speed independent of an object’s motion, two observes in relative motion do not have to agree on whether two events occurring in different locations are simultaneous. Because the two observers see the order of events happening at different locations, they don’t need to agree. 

","A. Two physicists, Michelson and Morley, conducted an experiment to test how the speed of light changed with motion but instead found the speed of light to be constant. Building on this Lorentz and FitzGerald, two other physicists, proposed that length contraction along could help explain the heavily criticized results of Michelson and Morley. Einstein built off of these works to formulate his theory of relativity that stated the speed of light was constant to all observers.

 

B. The key property distinguishing inertial and non-inertial frames and observes is that inertial frames and observers move at constant velocities. If there is acceleration or a change in velocity it is no longer an inertial frame or observer. Inertial observers must agree on physical laws, although they can disagree on descriptions of motion. 



C. Einstein formulated his theory from two key postulates. The first was that the speed of light is measured to be the same by all observers, and the second is that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.

Yes, the truck could fit from the door operator’s perspective because of length contraction. When the truck is moving close to the speed of light, the truck appears shorter in the frame of the door operator. 



(b) 

No, from the truck driver’s perspective the truck is always 10 m long and the station is always 9 m or less. 



(c) 

Relativity allows you to reconcile the views of the door operator and truck driver because the ends of the truck are in different locations and the door operator and truck driver are in different locations, so simultaneity is dependent on the observer’s frame.

","a) The result that the speed of light is constant motivated Einstein’s theory and the experiment with an interferometer conducted by Michelson and Morley found this result.  



(b) 

An inertial frame is a frame corresponding to an observer moving at constant velocity, whereas a non-inertial frame involves acceleration. 



(c) 

The speed of light is measured to be the same by all observers.

The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.

mrk4tq@virginia.edu,,Kersey,Madison,"a. Yes, due to the idea of length contraction which states that moving objects cause them to appear shorter. So, the closer the truck is moving to the speed of light, the shorter the truck will appear in the door operator's frame.



b. No, from the truck driver’s frame perspective the truck is 10 meters long, and the scanning station is 9 meters - so it will not fit 



c. The word relative in relativity means “depending on your reference frame.” And the door operator and truck driver are not in the same reference frame. The length of an object depends on the motion of the observer. Therefore, they do not agree because the ends of the truck are in different locations, therefore the truck driver and the door operator do not have to agree because simulaneity is observer dependent.","a. The experiment that motivated Einstein’s theory was that of Michelson and Morley, where they found that there was a constant speed of light that was independent of Earth’s motion. Einstein then used that to figure that the speed of light is measured to be the same by all observers.

b. An inertial frame is one in which an observer (or frame) experiences no acceleration. Which means no changes in speed or direction. 

c. The two postulates of special relativity are that the speed of light is measured to be the same by all observers and the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames",2,2,2,0,0,3,1,2,0,2,1,2,1,0,1,3,3,2,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,2020-09-25 13:05:30 -0400,2020-09-25 13:10:04 -0400,2020-09-25 13:10:16 -0400,2020-09-25 13:10:54 -0400,2020-09-25 13:11:50 -0400,2020-09-25 13:12:27 -0400,2020-09-25 13:13:13 -0400,2020-09-25 13:13:34 -0400,2020-09-25 13:14:24 -0400,2020-09-25 13:15:56 -0400,2020-09-25 13:16:46 -0400,2020-09-25 13:23:02 -0400,2020-09-25 13:24:47 -0400,2020-09-25 13:25:11 -0400,2020-09-25 13:25:33 -0400,2020-09-25 13:27:09 -0400,2020-09-25 13:27:17 -0400,2020-09-25 13:27:31 -0400,2020-09-25 13:29:23 -0400,2020-09-25 13:29:43 -0400,2020-09-25 13:30:22 -0400,2020-09-25 13:32:09 -0400
ak6xbg@virginia.edu,,Khwaja,Ayma,"a.) From the door operator’s perspective, yes it can fit. The length contraction of a moving object makes them appear shorter. If the truck moves closer to the speed of light, the scanning station appears shorter to the door operator. 



b.)  From the truck driver's perspective, no. In his frame the truck is 10 m long and the scanning station is 9 m long or less if he's moving faster.



c.) Relativity allows us to reconcile that different observers do not have always have to agree. To the door operator, there can be a time where the space truck passes through the scanning station. As for the truck driver, his truck can never fully fit through the scanning station, from top to bottom. Simultaneity, concerning the top and the bottom of the truck, is thus observer dependent.","a.) The Michelson & Morely experiment's key result that motivated Einstein's theory was a constant speed of light, independent of Earth’s motion. Einstein builds his theory around one postulate: the speed of light is measured to be the same by all observers.



b.) An inertial frame  is a reference frame where an object stays either at rest or at a constant velocity unless another force acts upon it. A non-inertial frame of reference is accelerating. Key property difference is thus acceleration.

jpk6vd@virginia.edu,,Kilduff,Jack,"1a. Because the observer is at rest, and the space truck is moving close to the speed of light, the observer will see length contraction and will think the space truck can fit through the scanning station. Length contraction is derived from the Lorentz factor.

1b. From the space truck’s perspective, the truck is stationary, and the scanning station is moving towards the truck near the speed of light. This will make the scanning station seem smaller than it actually is (length contraction again), and the truck will not think they can fit through.

1c. Relativity states that the laws of physics and the speed of light must always be constant, but distances, times, and directions are all relative. Because the two observers (the truck and the scanning station) are in different inertial frames, they can disagree on the distances.

","2a. Michelson and Morely Experiment proved that the speed of light was constant.

2b. An inertial frame is one that is not accelerating. It can be moving at a constant velocity, but it cannot change its speed or direction. Otherwise it would be non-inertial.

joyfulkim83@gmail.com,,Kim,Joy,"A) Yes, the spack truck can fit inside the station from the operator’s perspective. The length of contraction moving objects causes them to appear shorter. 

B) No, the truck cannot fit inside the station from the truck driver’s perspective. It cannot fit because in his perspective the station will always be 9m or less, and the space truck will always be 10m. If he’s traveling at the speed of light, it is less.

C) From the standpoint of the door operator, there can be a time when the space truck fits inside the scanning station due to length contraction. From the truck driver’s perspective, the space truck will never be able to fit inside the scanning station. They can disagree, because their positions are different and simultaneity is observer dependent.

","A) Magnet and conductor thought experiment. 

B) An inertial frame is a subset of a reference frame. Corresponding to an observer with no acceleration (constant velocity), an inertial frame moves with constant velocity. Observers in inertial frames may not agree on the description of motion but can agree that the laws of physics are obeyed. Hence, an inertial frame if and only if it is moving with constant velocity. If a train moves at constant speed in a straight line, it is an inertial frame. If it is speeding up or moving around a corner it ceases to be an inertial frame. Any acceleration makes a frame non inertial.

 

C) The speed of light is measured to be the same by all observers. The law of physics is the same in all inertial reference frames.

Yes, the truck can fit inside the station from the door operator’s perspective because of length contraction. Moving objects appear to be shorter from the operator’s perspective. 



No, the truck can not fit inside the station from the driver’s perspective. In the driver’s frame, the truck is 10 m long and the station will be 9 m long or less. 



Depending on whose perspective you’re looking at, length is relative. From the door operator’s perspective, the length of the truck becomes shorter. From the driver’s perspective, the length of the station can become shorter. Understanding that length is relative depending on the frame is crucial in understanding the different viewpoints of the operator and driver.

","Michelson and Morley’s experiment on the constant speed of light motivated Einstein’s theory. Their interferometer experiment found that the speed of light is constant.  



In an inertial frame, an observer experiences no acceleration. Inertial frames have constant velocity. Non-inertial frames have acceleration. 



The two postulates are that the speed of light is measured to be the same by all observers and the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.

b) A key property that distinguishes an inertial frame from a non-inertial frame is acceleration.

gtk3ted@virginia.edu,747412947,Kuehn,Grant,"A) Yes, from the perspective of the door operator, the space truck will be able to fit inside the station. This is because the truck appears to be shorter due to length contraction as viewed by the door operator, observers perceive that objects moving toward them are contracted by the Lorentz factor of the object. Because the truck is traveling near the speed of light, it will appear contracted enough. 

B) No, from the drivers perspective, his truck remains 10m long because he is part of the same inertial frame as the truck. It will not be able to fit because in his frame he is not moving and the station actually appears smaller to him. 

C) Special relativity allows for us to reconcile these differences because of the effects of time dilation and lengths being relative in special relativity. From the inertial frames of the driver and the operator, each’s clock runs slow. Because of the effects of time dilation, the driver and the door operator will agree on the velocity, but not on the time and the effects of length contraction will give them different relative lengths of the truck.

psk7pqw@virginia.edu,,Kulkarni,Pallavi,"(a) Yes, the truck can fit from the perspective of the door operator. The door operator is an inertial observer in this case and according to special relativity, moving objects lengths contract along the line of motion for inertial observers. So, for the door operator, the truck does not appear to be 10 m, rather something shorter since in his/her perspective, the length of the truck is contracted. 

(b) No, from the truck driver’s perspective, he cannot fit through. This is because in his perspective, he is at rest, and the space station’s length is appeared to be less than 9 meters, since the truck is driving at a speed near the speed of light, so length contraction takes place here. 

(c) Here, this is due to length contraction. Length of an object along its line of motion is dependent upon the observer. This is why it makes sense why the truck driver and door operator would disagree. As explained before, the truck driver is not moving in his frame, so the length of the space station contracts. For the observer, the length of the truck contracts. This is all due to length contraction, which is observer dependent as said by relativity. Also here, simultanaety is observer dependent. From the truck's perspective, the ends of his truck will never be in the station at the exact same time, but for the door operator, he can see there be an instant at which both ends are in at the same time and this is due to length contraction and the fact that simultanaety is observer dependent for events at different locations (since the ends of the truck are at different locations.

cel9yft@virginia.edu,cel9yft,Locuratolo,Collin,"From the door operator’s perspective, the truck can fit inside the station. This is due to length contraction. Length contraction is when moving objects are perceived to be shorter to the observer. Since the door operator is an observer in this scenario, the truck will appear shorter while moving through the station, and therefore, will be short enough to fit inside the station. 

From the truck driver's perspective, the truck cannot fit inside the station. Length contraction only applies to observers, and in this case, the driver is not an observer, as they are inside the truck. 

Relativity allows me to reconcile the views of the door operator and truck driver because the door operator is in an inertial frame, while the truck driver is not in an inertial frame. Special relativity, and length contraction, applies to observers in inertial frames, like the door operator. Special relativity does not apply to non-inertial frames and observers, like the driver in this case. 

","The experimental result that motivated Einstein’s theory was that the speed of light was constant, and this was an experimental result of the Michelson and Morley experiment.

The key property that distinguishes an inertial frame from a non-inertial frame is that observers in an inertial frame have zero acceleration, or are in constant velocity. If there is any change in acceleration, like a train speeding up, or slowing down, then that train would become a non- inertial frame.

b) The truck driver does not perceive relativistic effects in his own frame, so the truck length does not appear contracted to him. The 10 meter truck simply would not fit in the 9 meter scanning station.

ham9aqv@virginia.edu,,Massie,Harrison,"a) Yes, the truck can fit from the operators perspective because of the effect of length contraction.  If the truck is traveling at velocities near the speed of light, it will have a high lorentz factor and thus experience length contraction inversely proportional to the lorentz factor.  From the operators perspective, he will see the truck decrease in length along the direction of its motion.

b)No, the truck cannot fit from the driver’s perspective.  This situation is parallel to the experiment with muons falling into earth’s atmosphere.  From the perspective of the truck (or muon), they do not perceive their own length to change because that is within their own frame.  However, they perceive the station to be moving towards them at a high velocity and thus the length of the station contracts.

c)This situation is allowed because in special relativity, where there are inertial frames as is the case here, different observers do not have to agree on simultaneity or events which happen at different locations, which is relevant to the closing of the doors. 

","a) Einstein was motivated by the recent discovery that the speed of light is constant and thus does not behave like other waves, where addition of velocity is possible.  This was experimentally proven by the Michaelson-Morely experiment where they used a beam splitter to measure the speed of light along different orientations to the earth’s motion.  

b) The key property that distinguishes an inertial frame from a non-inertial frame is that in an inertial frame there is no acceleration.

c) The two postulates on which Einstein formed his theory are that the speed of light is measured to be the same for all observers, and that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames.

sm7fm@virginia.edu,,McCain,Sydnie,"a) Yes, because if the truck driver is moving close to the speed of light, length contraction would make the 10m truck appear shorter relative to the door operator at rest. 



b)No. This is because although It may appear shorter to the driver, the scanning station will always be 9m long, the truck 10m.



c) In special relativity, inertial observers do not have to agree on length. Length is dependent on the motion of the observer.

If the space truck was stationary it would not be able to fit inside the station, however, since it is moving at a large fraction of the speed of light and the door operator is stationary, the contraction of the space truck will allow it to fit entirely inside the station. From the truck driver's perspective it would seem as if it did not fit in the station. While it is a peculiar paradox, it is made clear that in relativity, simultaneity is relative to each observer, so the truck driver and door operator do not actually have to agree on what happened.

From the driver's perspective, it is the station that is moving towards the truck at close to the speed of light and the truck is stationary. This means that the effects of contraction will apply to the station making the station even shorter and not allowing the truck to fit. 

","(a) He was motivated by the experimental result that the speed of light is measured to be the same by all observers. This result was found in the Michelson-Morley Experiment.

am5zm@virginia.edu,,Morgan,Abigail,"a) Yes, it can because due to length contraction the door operator will perceive the moving object (the truck) to be shorter than it actually is. 

b) No, because the truck driver perceives the scanning station to be shorter than it actually is because in the driver’s frame they are stationary and the station is moving towards them and thus will experience length contraction. 

c) Relativity allows the truck driver and the door operator to have different opinions on the length of the truck because length is one thing observers don’t need to agree on under special relativity. They only need to agree on the speed of light and the laws of physics.

a)	Yes, the 10 meter truck can fit inside the 9 meter station as, from the perspective of the operator, the truck will contract along its axis of motion by the Lorentz factor. At speed close to the speed of light this factor could be much larger then the needed 1.11 to allow the truck to fit (from the perspective of  the operator.)

b)	No, from the perspective of the truck, the station is moving toward the truck at speeds close to the speed of light, and thus, the station’s length will contract along its axis of motion. As a result, the station will be even less then 9 meters long from the perspective of the truck, while the trucks length will remain unchanged at 10 meters. Because the truck is longer than the station, it will not fit.

c)	Relativity says that two observers in different reference frames do not have to agree about the simultaneity of events at different locations. In this case, the two observers are in different reference frames, moving relative to each other at speeds close to the speed of light and the two ends of the truck (inside the station at entry, outside station at exit) are at different locations, so the two observers can disagree on the simultaneity of events at these locations. The events the observers disagree upon is whether both of these ends of the truck are in the station at the same time. This results from the relativity of length and time according to the theory of relativity. 

","a)	The Michelson & Morely experiment found that light moves at the same velocity regardless of what direction the light was moving with regards to earth’s motion. This contradicted the idea that there was an aether through which light propagated and who’s motion affected the speed of light. This result hinted at a constant speed of light,  an idea which was central to Einstein’s later theory of special relativity.

b)	Acceleration. An inertial reference frame is one that is not accelerating, while a non-inertial reference frame is.  

c)	Special Relativity was based on two central tenets: 1. The speed of light is constant for all observers. 2. Observers in inertial reference frames will always agree on the laws of physics.

kn6zuq@virginia.edu,,Nigam,Krutik,"From the door operator’s perspective, the space truck can fit inside the station. The length contraction of the moving object causes it to appear shorter to the door operator. Given that the space truck is moving close to the speed of light, this effect is amplified as the space truck becomes shorter.

From the truck driver’s perspective, the space truck can never fit entirely inside the scanning station. In his frame, the truck is always 10 m long, and the scanning station is always 9 feet in length. Since he is traveling near the speed of light, this 9 m length is actually even shorter due to his perspective of length contraction. 

For the door operator, the two ends of the truck can be inside the scanning station at a certain instant in time. However, the two ends of the truck can never be inside the scanning station at any one point from the truck driver’s perspective. Although one could argue non-relativity of simultaneity contradicts this idea, the main distinction is that the two ends of the truck are at different locations (not the same location). Thus, the two do not have to agree that the truck (meaning both ends of the truck) are simultaneously inside the scanning station (relativity of simultaneity). 

","For Einstein to pursue his incredible research, he based things off the assumed idea that the speed of light is constant and does not change, no matter what observer you are or what other factors may be at play. He accepted this as a fact, empirically verified - allowing him to fully pursue implications of this fact. The experiment that found this result was the Michelson-Morley experiment, in which they measured the speed of light bouncing back off of two mirrors through a beam splitter with the rotation of the Earth simulated by the beam splitter. 

An inertial reference frame is very different from a non-inertial frame in that an inertial frame is one in which objects move at constant velocity, thus possessing no acceleration. Those in inertial frames agree that the laws of physics are obeyed. 

The two postulates that form the basis for Einstein’s Theory of Special Relativity are that (1) the speed of light is measured to be the same by all observers and (2) the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. Although the implications of these two postulates are a bit more complex, the Theory basically boils down to these two ideas. The reason it is ""special"" is because the 2nd postulate only applied to observers in inertial frames.

(b) The truck cannot fit inside the station from the truck driver's perspective because he is moving at the same speed as the truck, so it will not contract at all from his perspective and the station will always be 9m (or shorter from his frame because from his view the station is moving towards him at close to the speed of light).



(c) The door operator and truck driver can have these different views because they do not share the same frame of reference, and because the ends of the truck are at different locations they do not have to agree that both ends were simultaneously inside the station.","(a) Einstein's theory was motivated by the experimental results of Michelson and Morley, who together concluded that the speed of light was constant. Their experiment used a beam splitter to split light into two paths, and measured when the two paths of light arrived at a photodetector. As they rotated the apparatus there was no difference in the signal, so they concluded the speed of light was constant. 



(b) An inertial frame is a frame of reference where the observer is not subject to any acceleration (their velocity is constant, moving or non-moving). A non-inertial frame is the opposite, where the observer is subject to some form of acceleration.

The door operator, despite being idle, is moving relative to the space truck very close to the speed of light. Thus, he/she experiences length contraction, so the length of the truck appears shorter than 10 m, fitting inside the station.



b. The truck cannot fit inside the space station from the driver's perspective. Since the driver is moving close to the speed of light, he/she experiences length contraction along the way of motion, so the 9 m long station appears even shorter in the eyes of the driver.



c. Special Relativity allows different observers from different inertial frames to disagree on the observers' lengths along the path of motion. They do not have to agree on whether the truck fits inside the station. Since the start and end of the truck are at different locations in space, the truck driver and the door operator do not have to agree that both ends are simultaneously inside the space station because simultaneity is dependent on the observer.

So even if the space truck is 10m in length, the door operator perceives the space truck to be shorter because it is in motion and is moving at a speed close to the speed of light, meaning that the operator could perceive the space truck to be short enough to pass through the scanning station.



(b) No because the truck driver does not see the space truck's length being contracted since the driver is in an inertial frame that is moving with the space truck and will always perceive the truck to be 1 meter longer than the scanning station.



(c) The driver may think that his/ her truck can only enter the scanning station at one point and then exit at another. From the operator’s perspective, however, the truck can enter and exit the scanning station simultaneously because the length is contracted and because the driver is moving relative to the operator. Since the simultaneity of events at different locations (front of truck and back of the truck) is observer-dependent, the operator can think that the truck entered and exited simultaneously even if the driver did not.

c.	Since simultaneity is observer dependent, the door operator and truck driver do not have to agree and be on the same terms.

Yes, from the door operator’s perspective, the truck can fit inside the station door. This is due to length contraction, which makes the length of an object moving close to the speed of light appear shorter.

Relativity allows me to reconcile the views of the door operator and truck driver because the operator and the driver are in two different reference frames. The door operator and the truck driver need to agree on things like the laws of physics and the speed of light regardless of what reference frame they are in. However, things like time and length are relative depending on your reference frame.

b)No, the length of the station will still appear to be 9m for the driver and the truck will still be 10m from his perspective. He is not an inertial observer thus he is not observing the same length contraction as the operator

c)From parts a and b, it is clear that the operator and the driver will have a disagreement on whether or not the truck can fit in the docking station. Special relativity can resolve this issue because the truck has two ends that will always be at different locations and by the relativity of simultaneity principle, the driver and operator do not have to agree that the ends of the truck were both in the station because simultaneity is observer dependent.

a) The truck can fit inside the station, but only from the door operator’s perspective: when objects move at a large fraction to the speed of light, they contract in the direction of motion, so the “10m” space truck would actually be less than 10 meters.

b) The truck cannot fit inside the station from the truck driver’s perspective: the frame of the driver is the same as the frame of the truck, so the contracting element would actually be the scanning station, which would be less than 9m to the driver. The 10m truck, which the driver still perceives to be 10m, would not be able to fit into the <9m station.

c) Relativity allows us to reconcile the differing views about whether the truck fits or not because time, distance, mass, and simultaneity are all terms that are relative to observers. Relativity states that the perceived length of the truck will be L/ℽ, where ℽ is the Lorentz factor (based on velocity), to each observer.

mws6wp@virginia.edu,,Shafer,Matthew,"A) If the truck driver is traveling close to the speed of light, it is possible for them to fit within the station. This is due to the length contraction that occurs when objects move close to the speed of light. 

B) No, from the truck driver’s perspective the truck cannot fit because they perceive their own time and length to be normal. 

C) Since the truck driver and station operator are in two different inertial frames (the truck driver at constant velocity near the speed of light and the station operator at rest), things such as distance and time appear differently. From the station operator, they witness the truck’s length contracting enough to fit inside of the station while the truck driver can see the station’s length contracting to an even smaller length. 

","A) Einstein was inspired to develop special relativity based off of the collective work of FitzGerald, Lorentz, and Poincare who were trying to justify the constant speed of light and length contraction based off of the experiment done by Michaelson and Morely which discovered that light travels at a constant speed.

ls5ek@virginia.edu,,Shaheen,Leah,"a) Yes due to length contraction. Length contraction makes objects appear shorter to observers when the objects move at high speeds (near the speed of light). So the operator will see both ends of the truck fit inside the station because the truck is moving close to the speed of light so it will be contracted from the operators point of view. 



b) No, in the truck drivers point of view/reference frame, the truck will not be able to fit inside the station because length contraction does not appear in his frame, it only appears to the observer. To the truck driver, the truck will remain 10 m long and the station will remain 9 m long.



c) Relativity means that the operator (the observer) and the truck driver do not have to agree on the simultaneity of the situation. For the operator, there will be a point where both ends of the truck will fit inside the station, however, there will not be a time that bot ends of the truck fit inside the station from the driver’s perspective.

From the driver's perspective, the scanning station is moving towards the speed of light and vice versa for the operator's perspective.

cs8jt@virginia.edu,,sohn,Chan Young,"a)Yes. From the door operator’s perspective, the space truck can fit inside the station because of length contraction. This is the idea that from an observer’s perspective, the lengths of moving objects are contracted along the direction of motion. So even if the space truck 10 m and the scanning station is 9m, the door operator will believe that the space truck will fit. 

b)No. In the frame of the truck driver, the space truck is always 10 m long and the scanning station cannot be greater than 9m. Due to the fact that the truck driver is said to be moving very close to the speed of light, it will cause the truck driver to think that the scanning station is less than 9 m. 

c)The reason for this reconciliation is the idea that simultaneity is observer dependent. Meaning that the door operator believes there is at time from his view point where both ends of the truck can be inside the scanning station and the truck driver believes that both ends of the truck cannot be inside the scanning station from his view point. Because of the fact that each end of the truck are in different locations, it is okay for these two people to have different views based on their view points.

From his perspective, there would be a period when the 10m truck contracts enough to fit inside of the 9m long station.



(b) No, the 10m truck would not fit inside of the station from the driver's perspective. This is because from his frame, the truck is always 10m long and the station is always 9m long or less. From his frame, the station would contract making its length less.

srs4xy@virginia.edu,,Stimpson,Sally,"Yes, if the truck is traveling close to the speed of light, length contraction will cause the truck to appear shorter. Thus, when the truck is close to the speed of light, it will appear shorter in  the door operator’s frame.



No, from the truck driver’s perspective, the truck is always 10m long and the scanning station is always 9m long or less due to length contraction.



Special relativity states that simultaneity is observer dependent. Therefore, different observers, in  this case the door operator and the truck driver, may have different views on the simultaneity of an event. In this case, the truck driver never views the doors closed simultaneously whereas the door operator does.

","The experimental result that motivated Einstein’s theory was the measurement of a constant speed of light. This conclusion was first reached during Michelson and Morley’s experiment in which they measured the speed of light using a beam splitter and found it to be constant.

hws8gt@virginia.edu,,Sublett,Harrison,"From the operator's perspective, the truck should fit due to length contraction (assuming that the truck is moving sufficiently close to the speed of light that the effect of length contraction causes the truck's length to reduce by at least one meter to fit in the nine meter gap). From the operator's perspective, the truck has shrunk. For the pilot, however, the length ahead of him seems to have increased. This was seen in the velocity raptor game, when the distances ahead of the raptor seemed to stretch as the raptor's speed approached light speed. The pilot and operator agree on their speeds relative to one another, and the pilot experiences time dilation.

ft7vfd@virginia.edu,,Tahir,Fatima,"it can fit inside the station from the door operator's perspective if he is simply an observer watching the space truck move close to the speed of light from a different frame because length contraction of moving objects can cause them to appear shorter for someone not in the same frame in the direction of the motion. BUT if he is in the same frame then it cannot fit because length contraction wouldn't have occurred from his and the driver's perspective.



No the truck cannot fit inside the station from the truck driver's perspective because length contraction would not occur in his frame for him. So the truck would remain 10m and the station would remain 9m.



It depends on whether they are in the same frame because if they are then they must agree on whether it can fit since length contraction would not have occurred for them. However, if the operator is just an observer watching from a different frame then they can have different views and still be right since length contraction is relative and depends on whether the observer is moving relative to an object.

yw6jd@virginia.edu,,Wang,Yilin,"a) From the door operator’s perspective, it is possible for the truck to fit inside the station because the length contraction of moving object causes the space truck to appear shorter to the door operator. The closer the space truck moves to the speed of light, the shorter it appears to be in the door operator’s frame. So it can appear to be less than 10m.



b) No, it can’t. Since the truck driver is in the same frame as the space truck, it will always be 10m long. Due to length contraction of moving object, the driver will perceive the scanning station to be 9m or shorter. Thus, the truck won’t fit inside the station in the driver’s view.



c) Both the truck driver and the door operator are in inertial frame, we can apply special relativity. Based on special relativity, the length is dependent on observers. observers do not have to agree on the simultaneity of events happening in different locations. Since the two ends of the truck are not at the same location, two observers don't have to agree that both ends are simultaneously inside the station.

dcw2rp@virginia.edu,,Whitney,Douglas,"a.  Yes, from the door operator’s perspective there can be a time in which the truck fits inside the station.  As an observer, the door operator perceives the truck’s length to be contracted if the truck is traveling close to the speed of light.



b.  No.  From the driver’s perspective, the truck will always be 10m and therefore won’t fit inside the station.  Since the driver is in his own frame, he doesn’t perceive the relativistic effects of length contraction when traveling close to the speed of light.



c.  Relativity allows these different views to be reconciled since time, mass, length, and simultaneity are all relative under the conditions of special relativity.  While the laws of physics can’t be violated, the observers do not have to agree on whether the truck fits in the station since simultaneity is relative.  The ends of the truck are at different locations, so the door operator and truck driver do not have to agree on whether the truck is ever simultaneously in the station.

","a.  The results of Michelson and Morley's experiment with light motivated Einstein's theory.  This experiment found no variation in the speed of light.  While many physicists of his day couldn't reconcile with the idea of light having a constant speed, Einstein accepted this idea and built his theory of special relativity around it.  



b.  If no acceleration is occurring, an inertial frame can exist.  Therefore, acceleration is the key difference between an inertial frame and a non-inertial frame.

tjw6fjx@virginia.edu,tjw6fjx,Willis,Tyler,"a) Yes it can. From the door operator's perspective, length contraction in special relativity tells us that he will see the space truck at less than 10 m long (i.e. he will see both ends of the truck inside the scanning station simultaneously). Therefore, he will be able to close the doors.

b) No it cannot. From the driver's perspective, the space truck will always be 10 m long, while the scanning station will contract to be less than 9 m long, again due to length contraction in special relativity. Therefore, the ends of the truck will never be simultaneously inside the scanning station.

c) In special relativity, observers are not required to agree on the lengths of objects because the end points of the objects they are looking at are at different locations. Special relativity allows observers to disagree because simultaneity is observer dependent.","a) Einstein just accepted the fact that the universal speed limit was 3x10^8 m/s, the speed of light.

ctw9jpk@virginia.edu,ctw9jpk,Woods,Cole,"a.From the door operator's perspective, the space truck can fit inside the station, because they are not inside the truck and they watch it move close to the speed of light so its length looks contracted to the door operator along the direction of motion.

b.From the truck driver's perspective, the truck cannot fit inside the station. This is because he is a part of the same system as the truck itself and time dilation does not apply to himself(and further length contraction doesn't apply), because to his frame of reference he is not moving but the station is moving closer and closer to him. 

c.Relativity allows you to reconcile these differing views, because time dilation applies to objects in motion. An observer outside the reference frame of a system might perceive that system's clock to run slow and their length to be contracted.

B)No, from the driver's perspective he will not fit because he sees the scanner rushing at the truck fast enough that it shrinks from 9 feet long to shorter than that. From the driver's perspective, the truck is always 10 feet long, no matter how fast he is driving. But the scanner can only shrink.

This is because the door operator is stationary and despite the truck initially being 1 m longer than the station, when the truck moves close to the speed of light, it appears shorter at one moment to the stationary door operator due to the length contraction.



(b) No, since the truck driver is in the truck which is moving at nearly the speed of light, he would not notice a difference in the length of the truck. However, the scanning station would appear smaller than it already is to him, so it would not fit.
