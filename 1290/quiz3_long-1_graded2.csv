1,1,hjt9wg@virginia.edu,,Terrazas,Hector,"a) The release of gravitational potential energy is proportional to the mass of the object it falls into and inversely proportional to its radius. This means that the more compact an object is, the larger the fraction of the rest mass energy that is released during accretion. 



b) From lowest to highest luminosities: Sun-like star, White dwarf, Neutron Star



c) This implies that white dwarfs' accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks since X-rays have smaller wavelengths than optical and UV radiation, and therefore higher energy than optical and UV waves.",0,2020-11-20 12:59:40 -0500
1,1,eag9sb@virginia.edu,,Galletta,Elise,"a. Black Hole accretion can be so luminous because black holes are very compact for their mass. The gravitational potential energy lost by the objects moving from the large radius to the small radius is proportional to what it is falling onto. The more compact and smaller the radius means that more energy will be released by each mass being accreted. Therefore, compact black holes with small radii are very luminous.

b. Sun-like star will have the lowest luminosity, white dwarfs will have the second lowest luminosity, and neutron stars will have the highest luminosity.

c. White dwarf accretion disks are cooler than black hole accretion disks. Luminosity is determined by Flux * Accretion area. Black holes have a smaller accreting area, but a larger luminosity, so their flux must be larger. White dwarfs have a larger accreting area, but a lower luminosity, so their flux must be lower. Flux is determined by temperature, so black holes must be hotter.

1,1,yw2aj@virginia.edu,,Wang,Yuyang,"a. Accretion is when the mass falls on the black hole. Since a black hole is a very compact object, the gravitational potential energy is very large. The gravitational kinetic energy converts into kinetic energy which is released as heat which becomes luminosity. Black holes have high luminosity since the conversion of energies is efficient. There is no surface for the matter to fall onto so matter will form an accretion disk. 

b. From lowest to highest, sun-like star, white dwarf, neutron star.

c. This implies white dwarfs are colder since short wavelengths mean higher temperature. They might be colder since they are smaller and less dense.",0,2020-11-20 13:00:49 -0500
1,1,zw3bq@virginia.edu,,Wang,Emma,"a. Black holes are small and compact for their mass, thus they release more gravitational potential energy when matter falling into the black hole changes from large radius to small radius. The energy released by accretion corresponds to the gravitational binding energy of the accreted matter. 



b. From highest to lowest: (3), (1), (2)



c. This implies that white dwarf accretion disks are cooler than black hole’s, because black hole’s accretion disks have large luminosities and small emitting areas and thus have to be very hot. White dwarfs are also cooler because it is supported by the electron degeneracy pressure, since they are too cold to depend on thermal gas pressure. Also according to The Wien's law, since white dwarfs emit optical or ultraviolet that are high frequencies, the temperature must be colder. 



",0,2020-11-20 13:00:52 -0500
1,1,jp5ycx@virginia.edu,,Pan,Julia,"a) Release of gravitational potential energy is proportional to the mass of the object it falls onto and inversely proportional to its radius. The more compact an object is, the larger the fraction of its rest mass energy that is released during accretion. This energy released is mainly in the form of light. Black holes are the most compact object so it is very luminous.

b) Lowest: Sun-like star, second: white dwarf, highest: a neutron star

c) White dwarfs accretion disks are cooler than black holes accretion disks. The higher the temperature, the higher the energy. X-rays are higher in energy than optical and UV rays so that means accreting black holes are hotter.  

",0,2020-11-20 13:01:22 -0500
1,1,amr4rnq@virginia.edu,,Rodriguez,Angelina Marie,"a) Because the release of gravitational potential energy is proportional to the mass of the object falling and inversely proportional to the radius, the more compact the object is (small radius), the more amount of rest mass energy is released during accretion, with half of that energy released being radiated as light energy, hence making it more luminous.



b) Most luminous: neutron star, Second luminous: white dwarf, Least luminous: sun-like star



c) White dwarf accretion disks are colder. Since they emit their light using optical or UV light, that means there is less energy than x-ray according to their differing wavelength and frequency. Because of black holes use x-ray light, they use more energy and are therefore hotter.",0,2020-11-20 13:01:25 -0500
1,1,am5zm@virginia.edu,,Morgan,Abigail,"(a) Accretion onto black holes is so luminous because the matter that accretes must lose so much gravitational potential energy, which is released in the form of light. The accreting matter must lose so much gravitational potential energy because the released energy must be directly proportional to the mass of the object and inversely proportional to the final radius of the accreting matter. Therefore, accretion onto more compact objects is more luminous, and since black holes are the most compact objects for their mass they would have a very high luminosity.



(b) Accretion-generated luminosity ordered from greatest to least: neutron star, white dwarf, Sun-like star



(c) This implies that the accretion disks of white dwarfs are colder than black hole accretion disks. One reason that they are colder is that white dwarfs are less compact than black holes, so the amount of energy lost by accreting matter would be smaller. Since there is less energy released, the flux would be smaller. Since flux is directly proportional to temperature, the temperature of the accretion disk would be lower.

",0,2020-11-20 13:01:38 -0500
1,1,kgk9ua@virginia.edu,,Kim,Kayla,"(a) This is because potential energy lost by matter moving from a very large radius to a very small radius is proportional to the mass it is falling onto and inversely proportional to the final radius. Hence, the more compact an object, the more energy released per unit mass accreted. Black holes are the most compact objects in the universe based on general relativity which is why sources powered by accretion only black holes can be so luminous.

(b) The neutron start is the most luminous, followed by a white dwarf, and then the sun-like star has the lowest luminosities.

(c) This implies white dwarf accretion disks are colder than the black hole accretion disks. The luminosity of accreting black holes is quite large and the emitting area is relatively small by astrophysical standards. Since the the flux is given by F = L/A, this means that black holes will have a very large flux. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that a large flux requires a large temperature to emit it so accretion disk must be very hot. Very hot objects emit at very short wavelengths, corresponding to X-rays. UV rays of the white dwarf have larger wavelengths compared to x-rays of the black hole accretion disks so the white dwarf is colder.",0,2020-11-20 13:02:06 -0500
1,1,anita.hsu.ho@gmail.com,,Ho,Anita,"a. when gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy then to heat energy, it comes out as luminous. Black holes have large gravitational potential energy

b. Lowest to highest: sun, white dwarf, neutron

c. Colder. shorter wavelength = hotter",0,2020-11-20 13:02:22 -0500
1,1,ads2cu@virginia.edu,,Shen,Xan,"a) The potential energy lost by matter shifting from a large radius to a small radius is proportional to the mass it falls onto and inversely proportional to the final radius



b) from lowest to highest luminosity: sun-like star, white dwarf, neutron star



c) Colder (longer wavelength of optical/UV is less energetic and thus less hot)",0,2020-11-20 13:03:50 -0500
1,1,ml3zz@virginia.edu,,Lee,Mihyung,"(a) since the black hole is very compact by their mass

(b) white dwarf , sun-like star, neutron star (small to increase)

(c)x-ray is small wavelengths and emitted in large temperature, so black hole accretion disk is hotter then white dwarf ",0,2020-11-20 13:04:36 -0500
1,1,tb8fu@virginia.edu,,Baird,Tristan,"a) As the change in gravitational potential energy is proportional to the mass of the accreting object and inversely proportional to its radius, and as black holes are the most compact objects in the universe, accretion onto black holes produce the greatest change in gravitational PE for gas accreting onto the black hole; this change in energy releases a large percentage of the mass' rest mass energy, which becomes radiated away as light, leading to extremely luminous accretion disks.



b) From lowest (first) to highest (last): Sun like star (2), white dwarf (1), neutron star (3)



c) This implies that accretion disks are colder for white dwarfs than for black holes. This is likely the case, because the mass of black holes are many times the mass of even the largest white dwarfs; thus, accreting matter onto black holes has the chance to lose much more of its rest mass energy, in turn creating extremely luminous and hot accrection disks.",0,2020-11-20 13:04:58 -0500
1,1,kac9us@virginia.edu,,Carson,Kate,"a) Looking at the formula for potential energy for accretion of gas is GMm/R, so the energy released per unit mass is proportional to M/R. This ratio is much bigger for a black hole than a normal star because black holes are so compact. Since black holes have the smallest possible radius for a given mass, they release the most gravitational potential energy, and this potential energy is then radiated as light which leads to higher luminosity. 



b) Lowest to highest: Sun-like star, white dwarf, neutron star



c) This implies that white dwarf accretion disks are colder. Black holes are very luminous because they have large accretion rates. Black hole accretion flows have a small emitting area, which explains why they are hot. Also, X-rays have higher frequencies and smaller wavelengths than UV, so that corresponds to a higher temperature. ",0,2020-11-20 13:05:51 -0500
1,1,ft7vfd@virginia.edu,,Tahir,Fatima,"(a) sources powered by accretion onto black holes can be very luminous because black holes are the most compact sources in the universe for their mass and the more compact an object is, the larger the fraction of its rest mass energy that is released during accretion



(B) sun-like star lowest luminosity, white dwarf, neutron star highest luminosity



(c)white dwarf accretion disks are colder and white dwarfs tend to cool down but black holes are much more compact and have higher luminosities so they emit in x-rays. Since hotter objects are more likely to emit in shorter wavelengths, it can be assumed that white dwarfs are cooler.



",0,2020-11-20 13:05:56 -0500
1,1,xq8zu@virginia.edu,,Qiu,Xinyue,"a) When the sources falls onto black hole, potential energy lost by matter moving from very large radius to small radius. It is proportional to the mass it is falling onto and inversely proportional to the final radius. Thus the black holes can be so luminous: it is because the as the mass object falls into is large, loss in potential energy is also large, and as the potential energy is converted into energy for luminosity in the process, the sources can be very luminous.

b) highest luminosity: 3) neutron star; modest luminosity: 1) white dwarf star; lowest luminosity: 2) Sun-like star

c) This indicates that white dwarf stars are colder than the black hole accretion disk. This is because optical light has a larger wavelength than x-ray, and a larger wavelength indicates a larger temperature, as shown by Wein's law. ",0,2020-11-20 13:05:58 -0500
1,1,jph2ek@virginia.edu,jph2ek,Harrington,Jack,"a) The potential energy lost by an object is proportional to the mass it's falling onto and inverse with the final radius. Since black holes are some of the most massive and most compact objects in the universe, an extremely high degree of energy ends up being radiated.

b) Most accretion would be a neutron star, followed by a white dwarf, with the sun-like star having the least amount of accretion.

c) Increasing temperature shortens the peak wavelength of emissions. Since x-rays are much shorter in wavelength than optical or ultraviolet light, this implies white dwarf accretion disks are colder than black holes'. This is because they are less compact and under less pressure, which emits less energy.",0,2020-11-20 13:06:18 -0500
1,1,agp3nc@virginia.edu,agp3nc,Parson,Alex,"(a) Sources powered by accretion onto black holes are so luminous because the gravitational potential energy lost by matter moving from a very large radius into a small radius is proportional to the mass of the ""object"" it is falling into. Since black holes are the most compact objects in the universe, accretion onto black holes has the greatest potential energy loss, and therefore the most energy released of which luminosity is a product. 

(b) neutron star would have the highest luminosity, followed by a white dwarf, and finally a sun like star would have the lowest luminosity generated by accretion onto them.

(c) This implies that the accretion disks of black holes are hotter than that of white dwarfs, shown by the smaller wavelengths emitted and the relationship between wavelength and temperature according to Wien's law. They may be hotter due to a higher kinetic energy caused by a higher angular momentum from a black hole relative to a white dwarf.",0,2020-11-20 13:06:22 -0500
1,1,hsj5sn@virginia.edu,,Jung,Skye,"a) Accretion onto black holes can be so luminous because the release of gravitational potential energy is proportional to the mass of the object it falls onto and inversely proportional to its radius.Therefore, the more compact an object is, the larger the fraction of its rest mass energy that is released during accretion (and black holes are the most compact sources in the universe for their mass).



b) 

1) White Dwarf (lowest luminosity)

2) Sun Like Star

3) Neutron Star (highest luminosity)



c) This implies white dwarfs accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks because higher temperature leads to a shorter wavelength (Wien’s Law), and X-rays have shorter wavelengths than UltraViolet according to the electromagnetic spectrum (X rays correspond to a higher temperature than UV or optical light).



",0,2020-11-20 13:06:31 -0500
1,1,tsquires01@gmail.com,tcs6ayj,Squires,Thomas,"(a) Sources powered by accretion onto black holes can be vary luminous because half of the gravitational potential energy that is lost by matter falling into a black hole is radiated away as light. This radiated light makes black holes luminous.



(b) A neutron star would have the HIGHEST luminosity, followed by a sun-like star. This would mean that a sun-like would have the LOWEST luminosity. This is because a neutron star would have the greatest mass while a sun-like would have the least mass. White dwarfs are in the middle because they are compact at high masses.



(c) This does imply that a white dwarf's inner accretion disk is cooler than a black hole's inner accretion disk. This is because of the lower temperature in a white dwarf's accretion disk because it is not rotating as quickly.",0,2020-11-20 13:06:31 -0500
1,1,ctt3fh@virginia.edu,,Tran,Chloe,"a) Since potential energy is proportional to M/R where M is the mass of the black hole and R is the radius of the black hole than the potential energy would be the greatest when M/R is really large and black holes being really compact for their mass makes this possible. This means that the energy associated to accretion is really large as well with is released as light or luminosity. 

b) neutron star --> white dwarf --> Sun-like star. neutron start has the highest luminosity. Sun-like star has the lowest luminosity. 

c) White dwarf accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks since UV/optical waves are longer than X-Rays that means that according to Wiens law the temperature associated with white dwarf accretion disks is lower since temperature is in the denominator.",0,2020-11-20 13:06:40 -0500
1,1,bs6dg@virginia.edu,,Selby,Brendan,"a) As objects move from areas of larger radius to smaller radius in a gravitational potential system, they translate their gravitational potential energy into other forms of energy. Gravitational potential energy is given by E=GMm/r; G is a constant and m depends on the mass of the gas being accreted (relatively constant), so we are left with M/r. In a black hole, there is a significant amount of mass in a tiny radius, giving an immensely large E, translated into luminosity.

b) From lowest to highest luminosity: sun-like star, white dwarf, neutron star.

c) This implies that white dwarf accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks, because hotter temperatures, due to Wein's Law that wavelength=2900000nm/T(k), produce smaller wavelengths, and x-ray emissions are smaller wavelengths than optical emissions.",0,2020-11-20 13:06:44 -0500
1,1,mhd9jg@virginia.edu,,Dwyer,Mary,"a) The potential energy lost by matter moving from very large radius to very small radius is proportional to the mass it is falling onto and inversely proportional to the final radius.  So, the more compact an object, the more energy released per unit mass accreted, the more luminous it becomes.

b)Nuetron stars are the most compact so they would be the most luminous, followed by white dwarfs, followed by sun like stars as the least luminous.

c)A white dwarf acrcretion disk is cooler than black hole acretion disks because it is less luminous and has a larger emitting area.",0,2020-11-20 13:06:45 -0500
1,1,jhb9mp@virginia.edu,jhb9mp,Blue,Josh,"a) As objects accrete onto a black hole, they lose gravitational potential energy and due to the compactness of black holes, these objects are able to get very close to the black holes. This means that objects lose a large amount of gravitational potential energy and a lot of this is released in the form of radiation, making them very luminous.



b) Lowest Luminosity: Sun

Middle Luminosity: White Dwarf

Highest Luminosity: Neutron Star



c) This would imply that the accretion disks are colder for white dwarfs. This is because the emitting area of a black hole is relatively small but the luminosity of an accreting black hole is large. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, a large flux requires a high temperature to emit it so the accretion disk for the black hole must be very hot. 

",0,2020-11-20 13:06:56 -0500
1,1,aa7vd@virginia.edu,aa7vd,Aggarwal,Akshet,"a) The energy released by accretion corresponds to the gravitational binding energy of the accreted matter. The change in the potential energy for accretion of gas of mass m onto an object of mass M and radius R is ≈ GMm/R. So, the energy released per unit mass which can be classified as luminosity is proportional to M/R and this ratio is much bigger for a black hole than a normal star because black holes are so compact.



b) 1- White dwarf (highest) 2- neutron star 3- sun like star (lowest)



c) This implies that white dwarf’s accretion disks are hotter than the black hole’s. This might be because of the greater mass of the higher luminosity of the white dwarf.

",0,2020-11-20 13:07:02 -0500
1,1,yw6jd@virginia.edu,,Wang,Yilin,"a) It is because the energy released per unit of mass, as we can see from the formula of the gravitational potential energy, is proportional to the mass it is falling onto and inversely proportional to the radius, we can see from that the change in the potential energy for accretion of gas of mass m onto an object of mass M and the radius R is GMm/R. And we know that black holes are the most compact, thus is able to maximize the ratio of M/R, which maximizes the energy released.



B) (highest luminosities)neutron star -> white dwarf -> sunlike star(lowest luminosities)



C) Optical or ultraviolet are with longer wavelength compared to x-rays, from Wien’s Law we see that means white dwarfs accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. They are colder because white dwarfs are less compact compared to black holes.",0,2020-11-20 13:07:08 -0500
1,1,bch8zsa@virginia.edu,505295743,Hall,Bryce,"(a) Sources powered by black hole accretion are so luminous because a large portion of the gravitational potential energy is lost during the process and this gravitational potential energy is converted into light (as well as kinetic energy). Total energy lost from gravitational potential energy is comparable to its rest mass energy, which explains why it is so luminous when accreting into a black hole. The greatest change in gravitational potential energy comes from making radius as small as possible, and black holes have the smallest radii for their mass, thus making the luminosity from black hole accretion very strong.



(b) Neutron star has most. Then white dwarf. Then Sun-like star. These are ranked by radius, as radius impacts the change in gravitational potential energy, with the greatest change coming from the object that has the smallest radius. 



(c) Using Wiens law, this would imply that white dwarf accretion is colder, as hotter objects radiate at lower wavelengths, and x-rays have lower wavelengths than optical or ultraviolet.",0,2020-11-20 13:07:15 -0500
1,1,jid4nse@virginia.edu,,Dornfeld,Josh,"a) Sources powered by accretion onto black holes are so luminous because the luminosity corresponds to gravitational potential energy, which is maximized with high mass and low radius. Black holes have the largest M/R ratio in the universe, so these sources powered by black hole accretion are the most efficient emitters of energy in the universe.



b) low to high



Sun-like star < white dwarf < neutron star



c) Flux = Luminosity / Area. Black holes have large luminosity and a small emitting area, so, therefore, have a larger flux than white dwarfs. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that in order to have a large flux, a large temperature is needed, so white dwarf accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. This follows the logic that hotter objects emit at shorter wavelengths, being X-Ray for black hole emission.",0,2020-11-20 13:07:19 -0500
1,1,jp6ax@virginia.edu,,Park,Jun Song,"a) Because black holes have a small radius proportional to their mass, and since the change in gravitational potential energy is proportional with their amount of energy released in accretion, black holes can be so luminous.



b) Neutron star has the highest, white dwarf has the second, and sun-like star has the lowest luminosity.



c)The accretion disks are colder in white dwarfs, since they emit most of their light in the optical or UV, while black holes emit mostly in x-ray. x-rays require more energy, since they are higher in the spectrum which means that it is hotter. If we were to take a more mathematical approach, we can see the relationship when solving Wein's law for Temperature(T). There is an inverse relationship between the wavelength of the light emitted, and temperature. Since optical or uv light has a greater wavelength, that means that the temperature is smaller. Similarly, since xrays have shorter wavelength, that means that their temperature is greater. ",0,2020-11-20 13:07:19 -0500
1,1,jrk2qtx@virginia.edu,,Kingsley,Juliet,"(a) Accretion onto black holes can be so luminous because gravitational potential energy is proportional to the mass of the object it falls onto and inversely proportional to its radius. This means that the more compact an object, the larger the fraction of its rest mass energy that is released during accretion. Black holes are the most compact sources in the universe for their mass so this means they would be very luminous from accretion. 



(b) The highest luminosity would be the greatest in a white dwarf because it gets more massive as its radius decreases. The next would be the neutron star because it is very massive. Lastly and least luminous would be a sun-like star. 



(b) Black holes accretion disks are hotter than a white dwarf because the black holes emit in the X-ray because they are very luminous with very small emitting areas. ",0,2020-11-20 13:07:38 -0500
1,1,nathanher26@gmail.com,,Her,Nathan,"1a) The largest change in gravitational potential energy involves making M as large as possible and R as small as possible in the proportion (M/R). Blackholes are extremely massive with a small radius, thus the ratio is extremely high. Which means that the gravitational potential energy lost from an accreting black hole will have an extremely high luminosity. 

1b) The lowest luminosity of an accreting object is a sunlike star. The next luminous is a white dwarf. This is because of how dense a white dwarf is. However, a neutron star is more dense which means that an accreting neutron star is the most luminous. 

1c) This implies that white dwarf accretion is not as hot as a black hole accretion. According to the Weins Law, the higher the temperature, the lower the wavelength is. Therefore, the since the blackhole emits at a lower wavelength, it means that it is hotter. The blackhole is hotter due to blackholes large luminosity and low area. Because the black hole is so luminous relative to the area, the flux is much higher than the white dwarf, thus it is hotter due to the Stefans-boltzmann law. (Flux= sigma (T)^4)",0,2020-11-20 13:07:40 -0500
1,1,mm3rd@virginia.edu,,McClafferty,Michael,"a.) Gas falling into a black hole loses gravitational potential energy, some of which can be radiated as light.



b.) Lowest is white dwarf for luminosity; then Sun-like star; then a neutron star in order of least to most luminosity.



c.) White dwarfs accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. Hot objects emit at shorter wavelengths like X-rays, so the black hole would be hotter.",0,2020-11-20 13:07:50 -0500
1,1,jc2ppp@virginia.edu,,Chun,Jimin,"a) Black holes are very compact for their mass so the change in the gravitational potential energy for matter accreting onto black holes is maximized, and this change is proportional to amount of energy released.



b) Lowest to highest luminosities: sun-like star, white dwarf, neutron star.



c) This implies that white dwarf accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks because hotter objects emit at shorter wavelengths and optical wavelengths are longer than x-ray wavelengths.

",0,2020-11-20 13:07:58 -0500
1,1,sjg7egt@virginia.edu,,Galletta,Sam,"a) since the release of gravitational potential energy (GPE) is proportional to its mass and inversely proportional to its radius, the more compact an object, the more energy released. Since black holes are the most compact objects in the universe, they give off a ton of energy in the form of light. 



b) (lowest to highest) white dwarf -> sun-like star -> neutron star



c) this implies that white dwarfs are colder than black hole accretion disks. I would say this because the frequency of a ultraviolet or optical wave is much less than an X-ray",0,2020-11-20 13:08:30 -0500
1,1,jdc3kt@virginia.edu,,Caracciolo,Jacob,"a) Since black holes are very dense and compact, the larger the rest mass energy is released during accretion. When matter falls into the black hole, some of gravitational PE is lost to KE and much irradiated into light.  

The total energy lost is comparable to its rest mass energy. The release of gravitational PE is proportional to the mass of the object it falls onto and inversely proportional to its radius

b) (3) neutron star, (1) white dwarf, (2) sun like star

c) White dwarvf accretion are cooler. Hotter objects radiate at smaller wavelengths, since x rays are smaller than optical/uv, black holes are hotter",0,2020-11-20 13:08:34 -0500
1,1,gmm8xhs@virginia.edu,,Makin,Grace,"a. Sources powered by accretion onto black holes can be so luminous because gas falling into a black hole loses gravitational potential energy and some of that can be radiated as light. 

b. Highest to lowest: neutron star, white dwarf, Sun-like star.

c. This implies that white dwarfs are colder because the mass of a white dwarf id less than 8 times the mass of the sun which means the degeneracy pressure stops the contraction of the core. ",0,2020-11-20 13:08:36 -0500
1,1,ak6xbg@virginia.edu,,Khwaja,Ayma,"(a) The luminosity of the accreting black holes is large and the emitting area is relatively small. The change in the gravitational potential energy for accretion of gas of mass m onto an object of mass M and radius R is ≈ GMm/R. Energy is proportional to M/R which can be maximized by increasing this ratio. Since black holes are so compact, this ratio is really high. 



(b) Highest to lowest -  Sun-like star (much larger and luminous), neutron stars, White Dwarf (smaller, less luminous)



(c) White dwarfs accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. White dwarfs are too cold to be supported by thermal gas pressure and are instead supported by electron degeneracy pressure. They are losing energy.",0,2020-11-20 13:08:39 -0500
1,1,amb4nc@virginia.edu,Chelseafc11,Bertone,Alex,"a) When accretion onto black holes occurs it is very luminous, this is because there is a lot of gravitational potential energy lost when matter moves from a large radius to a small radius and is proportional to the mass falling onto it and inversely proportional to the final radius. Because black holes have such a small radius and a large mass they are extremely compact (the most compact object allowed by general relativity) and therefore there is more energy released per unit mass accreted, resulting in a high luminosity.



b) From lowest to highest luminosities: sun-like star, white dwarf, neutron star. 



c) This implies that white dwarfs' accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. Since the emission for white dwarfs is of higher wavelengths which correspond to colder temperatures. The longer the wavelength, the hotter the temperature of the accretion disk.",0,2020-11-20 13:08:42 -0500
1,1,mra5be@virginia.edu,,Abruzzo,Massimo,"(a) Sources powered by accretion onto black holes can be so luminous because black holes are astronomically most compact objects allowed in general relativity. The release of gravitational potential energy is proportional to the mass of an object and inversely proportional to its radius. Therefore, black holes allow for accreting material to release the most amount of gravitational potential energy, which about half is radiated as light. 

(b) The most luminous would come from accretion onto the neutron star, then the white dwarf, and the least luminous would come from accretion onto the Sun-like star.

(c) This implies that white dwarfs' accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks because white dwarfs' accretion disks radiate light at a longer wavelength (lower frequency) than black hole accretion disks. In other words, the light emitted by white dwarf accretion disks has less energy and therefore less temperature than the black hole accretion disks, since shorter wavelength radiation carries more energy and more temperature for the black hole accretion disk. 

",0,2020-11-20 13:08:46 -0500
1,1,cpw2ka@virginia.edu,,Worden,Colby,"A)Black holes are super small for their mass, so they can attract mass from a very large distance due to their high gravity. As the mass approaches the black hole, it has lost a ton of gravitational potential energy that gets converted into kinetic energy, thermal energy, and luminosity

B) Neutron star has the highest luminosity, white dwarfs are in the middle, and sun-like stars are the least luminous.

C) Accreting white dwarfs are colder than accreting black holes because, as Wien's law shows us, hotter objects have a thermal radiation with higher frequency and lower wavelength than colder objects",0,2020-11-20 13:08:53 -0500
1,1,ctw9jpk@virginia.edu,ctw9jpk,Woods,Cole,"a. Black holes are extremely massive for their area, and they accrete a ton of matter for their astrophysical size. The largest possible change in potential energy comes from making mass as large as possible and radius as small as possible. As gas falls into a black hole, it loses gravitational potential energy, and some of that energy can be radiated away as light. 



b. Most luminous = Neutron Star. Second-most luminous = white dwarf.  Least luminous = Sun-like star



c. This implies that white dwarfs' accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. X-rays have a smaller wavelength than optical or ultraviolet waves. According to Wien's Law as temperature increases, the peak wavelength would decrease. Therefore, an object which emits in the optical or ultraviolet will have a higher peak wavelength(white dwarfs) and therefore a smaller temperature. An object that emits in the X-ray portion of the electromagnetic spectrum will have a lower peak wavelength and therefore a higher temperature. ",0,2020-11-20 13:08:58 -0500
1,1,crf2fj@virginia.edu,,Foutz,Colin,"a) Because the release of gravitational potential energy is proportional to mass of the object being accreted onto and inversely proportional to its radius, this means that compact objects have the most energy released during accretion, and black holes are the most compact objects we know of, thus they are the most luminous when being accreted onto.

b) Highest (1): neutron star, (2): white dwarf, Lowest (3): Sun-like star

c) Hot object correspond to emitting shorter wavelengths, such as X-rays. This implies that accretion disks of black holes are hotter than white dwarf accretion disks.",0,2020-11-20 13:09:00 -0500
1,1,cas6mu@virginia.edu,,Smith,Catherine Claire,"A) Black holes are some of the most luminous sources in the universe because the release of gravitational potential energy is proportional to the mass of the object that it falls onto and inversely proportional to its radius — and we know that black holes are the most compact sources, and the more compact the object, the larger fraction of its rest mass energy is released during accretion as light.   

B) neutron star (highest luminosity), white dwarfs (second highest), sun-like star (third highest). 



C) Black hole accretions disks are hotter than white dwarfs accession disks b/c when material falls into the black Hole, energy is released due to the friction between the disks ",0,2020-11-20 13:09:01 -0500
1,1,jb7sx@virginia.edu,jb7sx,Burns,Jade,"a) Sources powered by accretion onto black holes can be so luminous because the energy released by accretion corresponds to the gravitational binding energy of the accreting matter. Based off of the equations, accretion and luminosity are related and since you can maximize the energy released per unit mass by making the ratio of M/R larger, this ratio becomes much larger for black holes because they are so compact. 

b) neutron star has highest luminosity followed by white dwarf followed by a sun-like star with the lowest luminosity

c) I think this implies white dwarf accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. I think they are colder because the black hole releases more energy due to the infall of matter that takes places whereas the white dwarf releases less, which implies that it would have a colder accretion disk. ",0,2020-11-20 13:09:17 -0500
1,1,dkb7bt@virginia.edu,,Bassford,Dana,"(a)  Referencing gravitational potential energy, explain why sources powered by accretion onto black holes can be so luminous.

This is because the Gravitational potential energy is lost by matter moving from a very large radius to a very small radius. Hence, the more compact an object is, the smaller its radius has become and  the more energy released per unit that can be released as light. The largest change in gravitational energy comes from making the mass as large as possible and the radius as small as possible. Black holes are the most compact objects allowed by general relativity thus it follows they would be extremely luminous.

(b)

The highest luminosity is neutron star it is more compact than white dwarf which is second and finally then sun-like star

C) we know that a small area means shorter wavelengths and higher temperature leading to high flux and large luminosity. White dwarfs are larger and because of this, the wavelengths will be longer and colder thus why they can be seen in the UV. Black holes emit in the X-ray because of their large luminosity and small emitting area. White dwarfs are not as compact and have a larger emitting area 

",0,2020-11-20 13:09:18 -0500
1,1,aa5nq@virginia.edu,,Akram,Amman,"A -

Black holes are so small for their mass that their pull can pull in things from far away with high gravitational potential energy and as the object moves in closer the energy is converted into other energy forms, such as X-rays.  All of the high GPE has to convert into something as the object moves closer to the center.



B.    Highest- Neutron Star, Middle- White Dwarf, Least Luminous – sun like star 



C. It would be cooler because hotter things shift their emission blue, which sends the emission into the X-ray range.  For hotter objects, thermal radiation shifts further left – Wien’s Law.

1,1,sk2ps@virginia.edu,,Kim,Shiyun,"a) The gravitational potential energy of the matter falling in to the black hole during accretion is lost, and its rest mass energy is radiated as light. Since the release of gravitational potential energy is proportional to Mass/Radius, black holes release a lot of energy due to being so compact for its mass.

b) Neutron star (highest luminosity) > White dwarf > Sun-like star (lowest luminosity)

c) Hotter objects emit at shorter wavelengths, so white dwarf accretion disks must be colder than black hole accretion disks. This is due to black hole accretion disks having a large luminosity but a small emitting area, hence a large flux. Large flux requires high temperatures to emit due to Stefan-Boltzmann law.

1,1,vbl5wqh@virginia.edu,,Lightfoot,Vale,"a) Black hole accretion has high efficiency ~10% and large accretion rates. Black holes are super compact, the release of gravitational proportional to them ass of the object it falls onto. 



b) 1) 



c) White dwarfs are colder than black hole accretion disks, because black holes have a very large luminosity",0,2020-11-20 13:09:30 -0500
1,1,kkd7w@virginia.edu,,Doty,Kyle,"A)	The change in gravitational potential energy is proportional to GMm/R, where m is the mass of the material being accreted, M is the mass of the black hole, G is the gravitational constant, and R is the radius. For black holes, the ratio of mass to radius, M/R, is extremely large. So, the gravitational potential energy of infalling gas is much higher than it would be for another stellar object, and some of this energy may be released as electromagnetic radiation.



B)	Highest Luminosity: Neutron Star. Middle Luminosity: White Dwarf. Lowest Luminosity: Sun-like star. This is due to the mass to radius ratio discussed earlier.



C)	Assuming both stellar objects follow a standard blackbody emission curve, this statement would imply that white dwarf accretion disks are cooler than those of black holes. As discussed in part B and A, the mass to radius ratio plays a crucial role in the gravitational potential energy exploitation of gas falling inward. As predicted, the black hole accretion disks exploit more gravitational potential energy for a fixed amount of gas than would less dense stellar objects.

b, highest luminosity is neutron star, middle is white dwarf, lowest luminosity is sun-like star

c,The accretion disks of black holes are hotter than that of white dwarfs as the accretion disks of black holes have a higher flux. Black holes are therefore hotter as their luminosity is the highest in number as their emitting area is small. Moreover, the temperature needed to produce x-rays is much higher",0,2020-11-20 13:09:40 -0500
1,1,rrf9wc@virginia.edu,,Fitzmaurice,Riley,"(a) these sources are so luminous because the potential energy that's lost by matter moving from a large to small radius is proportional to that mass it's falling onto and inversely proportional to the final radius. Black holes have the smallest possible radius for a given mass so therefore they release the most gravitational potential energy. The large luminosity therefore is due to the large accretion rates and the small emitting area of black holes.



(b) The order from lowest to largest luminosity that would be generated is sun-like star, white dwarf, and neutron star as neutron stars. 



(c)  This implies that the accretion disks of white dwarfs are colder. This is the case because they have lower frequency.",0,2020-11-20 13:09:46 -0500
1,1,kll3qr@virginia.edu,,Louie,Kimberly,"A) The potential energy lost by the pieces of matter moving from a larger radius to a smaller radius is inversely proportional to the final radius of the matter and proportional to the mass of the object it is falling into. Black holes are really dense and so this increases the energy released per unit mass accreted.



B) lowest luminosity –> sun like star, white dwarf, neutron star <- Highest Luminosity because ordering by density and neutron stars are very close to black holes in densities and white dwarfs are denser versions of the sun like star



C) This implies that white dwarfs’ accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. Looking at the light spectrum, visible light waves have a longer wavelength than x-rays so white dwarfs accretion disks emit longer wavelengths. The hotter the temperature, the shorter the wavelengths get so the white dwarf’s are longer and colder than the black holes’.

1,1,htg5eg@virginia.edu,,Gould,Harry,"(a) The accretion onto black holes is so luminous due to the fact that a black hole is the most compact thing for its mass. Because it is so compact its radius is very small and since gravitational potential energy is proportional to M/R the smaller this radius the larger gravitational potential energy. As something accretes into a black hole the large decrease in gravitational potential energy releases energy in a very luminous form.



(b) Lowest luminosity would be (2), the sun-like star, then (1) white dwarf, then highest would be (3) the neutron star.



(c) This implies that white dwarfs accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. hotter objects emit at shorter wave lengths and x-rays are shorter wave lengths. It is so hot because black holes have a very large flux because F=L/A and their emitting area is very small. things with large flux mean large temperature.",0,2020-11-20 13:10:02 -0500

Because black holes are such compact objects, the result is a very high luminosity.  Also, the energy released per unit is very large which results in great luminosity.

1,1,mws6wp@virginia.edu,,Shafer,Matthew,"A) The accretion disk of black holes can be so luminous because as accretion material loses potential energy as it approaches the black hole the lost energy is turned into kinetic energy and light. Since black holes are so small but have such massive gravity fields, the amount of energy turned into light is massive. Black holes are also very efficient at producing light from their accretion material.

B) Sun-like star would be the least luminous to accrete on, a white dwarf would be more luminous than the star, and then a neutron star would have the most luminosity.

C) Since white dwarfs accrete in the visible or ultraviolet spectrum that means they are colder than a black hole that accretes in the x-ray spectrum. This is because hotter temperatures emit electromagnetic waves in shorter wavelengths. Since visible light has a longer wavelength than an x-ray, then the black hole must be hotter.

Some of this energy is radiated as light, and since black holes are compact for their mass, that means this matter is losing a massive amount of potential energy, and lots gets emitted as light, making this accretion so luminous.

b) White dwarf has the lowest

Sun-like star has the second lowest

Neutron stars have the highest

c) This implies that white dwarf stars are cooler because according to Wien’s law, the larger the temperature, the shorter the wavelength. So since white dwarf stars emit in optical or ultraviolet, which are longer than X-ray wavelengths, therefore they must be cooler than accreting black holes. ",0,2020-11-20 13:10:21 -0500
1,1,jeb3be@virginia.edu,,Bernstein,Joel,"a)The emission from accretion is dependent on the gravitational potential energy of they system, which itself is dependent on the mass to radius ratio. Black holes are extremely massive and have very small radiuses relative to that mass, so GPE is large. This means that during accretion, a greater proportion of the rest mass energy is radiated, leading to the luminous sources we see.



b) From lowest to highest luminosity: Sun-like star, white dwarf, neutron star



c) This implies that the white dwarf accretion disks are colder than black hole ones. This is because they rely on electron degeneracy pressure, which is more reliant on density than temperature itself. It is held together by the repellant nature of fermions and thus can emit light in a cooler temperature and longer wavelength.",0,2020-11-20 13:10:27 -0500
1,1,ms2fq@virginia.edu,,Santucci,Michael,"a)	Sources powered by accretion onto black holes can be so luminous because as the gas falls towards the black hole, it’s radius decreases, which causes its gravitational potential energy to decrease. Some of this energy goes to increase the kinetic energy of the gas, while other is radiated away by light, which causes the luminosity to be large.

b)	The object with the lowest luminosity would be the white dwarf, then the sun-like star, and the highest would be the neutron star.

c)	This implies that white dwarf accretion disks are cooler than black hole accretion disks. Using Wien’s Law, the peak wavelength for the white dwarfs is larger than the black hole, which means that the temperature for white dwarfs is lower.

1,1,afg4pr@virginia.edu,,Gagin,Angela,"a) Gravitational potential energy release is directly proportional to the mass of the object something is falling onto, yet inversely proportional to the radius, so since black holes are the most compact objects in the universe considering their mass, it follows that they would power the most luminous things in the universe.



b) THIS IS FROM HIGHEST TO LOWEST LUMINOSITY

1. Neutron star

2. White dwarf

3. Sun-like star



c) This implies that white dwarf accretion disks are colder than the accretion disks of black holes, as X-rays are higher energy than visible light ",0,2020-11-20 13:10:42 -0500
1,1,rap7qb@virginia.edu,,Power,Riley,"a) Sources powered by accretion onto black holes can be so luminous because the release of gravitational potential energy is proportional to the mass of the object it falls onto and inversely proportional to its radius. Since black holes have the smallest possible radius for a given mass, they release the most gravitational potential energy. So, black holes are very luminous, have a very small emitting area, and have large accretion rates. The black hole accretion flows also have a small emitting area, which explains why they are so luminous. 



(b) Neutron star (highest luminosity) > white dwarf  > sun-like star (lowest luminosity)



(c) This does imply that accreting black holes' accretion disks are hotter than accreting white dwarfs' accretion disks. Accreting white dwarfs may be colder because their emitting area is larger than that of a black hole, and so they accrete less, and their emitting area is larger than that of black holes. So, because Flux is equal to Luminosity/ Area, and Area for a white dwarf is larger than the area for a black hole, the Flux of a black hole is smaller. Then, because the flux of a white dwarf is smaller, the Temperature is smaller, because we find Temperature of an accretion disk by dividing Flux by Stefan's constant, and raising it to the 1/4.

1,1,bd4bk@virginia.edu,,Danek,Brennan,"a) Accretion onto a black hole can be very luminous because gravitational potential energy is lost when an object moves closer to another object. this change in potential energy is proportional to the mass of the larger object and inversely proportional to the final radius. Black holes by definition have the most mass-radius ratio, and so the amount of gravitational potential energy lost when matter falls into black holes is much greater than for matter falling into other objects. This energy gets released partially as light, making black hole accretion very bright

b) Neutron star has the highest luminosity because they are very small and very dense. white dwarf would have the next highest luminosity, as they too are much denser than normal stars, but they are not as dense as neutron stars. a sun-like star would have the least luminosity from accretion because it is relatively large and less dense than the other 2

c) white dwarf accretion disks are implied to be much colder than black hole accretion disks because Wien's law says that hotter objects have shorter wavelengths, and x rays are shorter than optical/UV radiation. white dwarf accretion is colder because less gravitational potential energy is released by the infalling matter as compared to infalling matter to a black hole, and gravitational potential energy release is what makes accretion luminous",0,2020-11-20 13:10:52 -0500
1,1,jpc4ax@virginia.edu,628466737,Carlton,John,"(a) Gas in an accretion disk (formed by the angular momentum of a spinning black hole or neutron star) falls into a black hole as layers of this gas lose angular momentum to friction from magnetic turbulence.  As this gas gets closer and closer to (and is eventually pulled into) the black hole, it loses potential energy, which is emitted as light.  The high mass and low radius of a black hole make the amount of potential energy emitted as light very high.

(b) Accretion onto a Sun-like star would generate the least luminosity, followed by a white dwarf, and then a neutron star would generate the greatest luminosity in its accretion.

(c)This implies that white dwarf accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks.  This might be because a white dwarf has a smaller mass and larger radius than a black hole, and therefore there is less potential energy to be converted to light within the system.",0,2020-11-20 13:11:01 -0500
1,1,ayl5fn@virginia.edu,,Liu,Andrew,"a) Sources powered by accretion onto black holes can be so luminous because the largest possible change in potential energy occurs when the mass is as large as possible and radius is as small as possible. Therefore, since black holes are so large in size and accrete a lot of matter, as gas falls into a black hole, gravitational energy is lost, creating energy that radiates as light. 

b) Lowest luminosity: Sun-like star, Second-lowest luminosity: White dwarf, Most luminosity: Neutron star 

c) This implies that white dwarfs accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks because of Wien’s Law, being that as temperature increases, the peak wavelength would decrease. X-rays have smaller wavelengths than ultraviolet waves. Therefore, emitting light in ultraviolet or optical has a higher peak wavelength so white dwarf accretion disk will have a lower temperature, and vice versa (X-Rays have lower peak wavelength so they have a higher temperature.

The more massive and compact an object is, the more rest mass energy is realized during accretion.  Therefore, more rest mass energy is released for more massive objects.  With a significant release of rest mass energy comes significant increases in luminosity.

b.  Lowest to highest:  Sun-like star, white dwarf, neutron star.  

c.  This implies that white dwarf's accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks.  Hotter temperatures result in shorter wavelengths.  Therefore, a much hotter black hole accretion disk will emit much shorter wavelengths.

This is because the release of gravitational potential energy is proportional to the mass of the object it falls into and inversely proportional to its radius; therefore, the more compact the object is, the more energy is released. Because black holes are very compact sources, they are very luminous.

b. White dwarf, Sun-like star, neutron star. White dwarf are 0.2~1.4Msun, so they have lower luminosity, same with a sun-like star. Neutron star is much more massive, so also more luminous.

b. Luminosity from highest to lowest: neutron star > white dwarf > Sun-like star



c. This implies that white dwarfs accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks because they are less dense than black holes. They have larger emitting areas for their mass.",0,2020-11-20 13:11:22 -0500

The more compact/dense an object is, the larger the fraction of its rest mass energy is released during accretion. 

Black holes are the most dense/compact object in the universe for their mass, meaning they have high masses and a small radius, which means it can release a lot of gravitational potential energy. 

The gravitational potential energy is released as light, so black holes become very luminous. 



b) Neutron star > sun like star > white dwarf 



c) Black holes would be hotter because they emit in X rays. Things that emit in x rays have large luminosities and small emitting areas (fits the description of black hole). X rays have short wavelengths making them hot and according to Wein’s law, increasing the temperature increases the flux which produces a large luminosity. 

Additionally, White dwarfs are not hot. They rely on pressure, not temperature, to resist gravity. So they are dim and relatively cool.

(b) From least to greatest luminosity: Neutron star, Sun-like star, White dwarf

(c) Due to degeneracy pressure, the electrons are fermions that obey an exclusion principle. They are too cold to be supported by thermal gas pressure and are instead supported by electron degeneracy pressure. ",0,2020-11-20 13:12:06 -0500
1,1,ard8jqr@virginia.edu,,Dreyer,Alize,"a. When matter accretes onto black holes, they go deeper into the gravitational potential, losing gravitational potential energy. This is inversely proportional to the radius of the surface, so the larger the mass of the object the matter is accreting onto and the decreasing size of its radius (in this case the object is a black hole), the more gravitational potential energy is lost. A large portion of this lost energy is converted into light, so these sources are very luminous. Because black holes are the densest objects for their size, they are very luminous when matter accretes onto them.



b.

Neutron star – highest luminosity

Sun-like star – medium luminosity

White dwarf – lowest luminosity



c. White dwarfs emit in optical or UV light, while accreting black holes emit in X-rays. X-rays are at a higher frequency and shorter wavelength than optical and UV light. This implies that white dwarf accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks because a higher flux requires a higher temperature to emit it, so the black hole disk is very hot.

(b) From highest to lowest luminosity, it goes neutron star, then white dwarf, then a sun-like star.



(c) This implies that white dwarfs are colder than black holes. Since white dwarfs a longer wavelength of light than black holes, as optical and ultraviolet light are longer wavelength than x-rays, this must mean that they are a lower temperature.

B.	This would be based on the overall radius of the object, so from least most luminous it would be a white dwarf, sun-like star, and neutron star.

C.	This does imply that white dwarfs are colder than black hole accretion disks. For one white dwarf emit their light in an extremely slow fashion, its is continuously cooling. Black holes accretion disks are illuminating so brightly in a small area that it becomes very hot, and the amount of heat is what brings it to x-rays.

The GPE lost is proportional to the mass that the gas is falling into and it is inversely proportional to the final radius it falls into. In other words, the most compact the object is, the greater the GPE loss will be, and since black holes are the most compact objects in the universe, accretion disks near black holes can be extremely luminous. 

b)	The highest luminosity of the accretion onto the objects would be a neutron star, followed by a white dwarf, and finally a Sun-like star. (Neutron highest, white dwarf middle, Sun-like star lowest).

c)	Based on Wein’s Law, as the wavelength of the emissions increase, the temperature decreases. Because white dwarfs emit in the UV/Visible Spectrum, the wavelength is higher relative to X-Rays, meaning that the temperature is lower, or colder, than the black hole accretion. The temperature would be colder because the white dwarf isn’t as compact as the black hole, so the gas isn’t losing as much GPE compared to the black hole accretion, which causes there to be less kinetic/thermal energy gained.

Black holes are the most compact objects in our universe under the laws of general relativity which means they can release the most energy per mass unit of any object in the universe.

B) Neutron star = most luminous, white dwarf = middle, sun-like star = least luminous

C) White dwarfs accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. This is because they have a lower spin. The higher the spin of an accretion disk the hotter the disk will be.

From lowest to highest luminosity, the ranking would be Sun-like star, white dwarf, and neutron star. Thus the Sun-like star would have the lowest luminosity and the neutron star would have the highest luminosity.



For black holes, the luminosity is quite large as explained in question 1. The large flux of black holes contributes directly to larger flux, which implies the large amount of temperature for emission. Hot objects emit at shorter wavelengths. For white dwarves, they emit at a longer wavelength due to lower temperature (they are not as compact).

1,1,kd5ah@virginia.edu,,Ding,Kehan,"a) Energy release by accretion corresponds to the gravitational binding energy of the accreted matter. The change in potential energy for accretion of gas of mass m onto an object or black hole of mass M and radius R is approximately GMm/R. Energy released per unit mass is proportional to M/R. Since black holes has large M/R ratio, it has high efficiency. The higher the efficiency the higher the luminosity according to the accretion luminosity equation.



b) highest: neutron star, middle: white dwarf, lowest: sun like star



c) This implies that white dwarf accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. Black hole accretion Luminosity is larger, emitting area is smaller, flux is larger compared to white dwarf. Stefan-Boltzmann law states a large flux require higher temperature to emit it so accretion disk must be hotter. Hotter objects emit in shorter wavelength. X-ray has shorter wavelength than optical or UV, so white dwarfs are cooler. ",0,2020-11-20 13:13:23 -0500
1,1,sbg8vb@virginia.edu,,Glasgow,Samuel,"a.	Considering accretion, the energy released by it corresponds to the gravitational binding energy of the accreting matter. This implies that the greater the energy released by this process is proportional to M/R. When this proportion is maximized this means that the energy radiated by the process is maximized. Black holes are compact (low R) and extremely massive. This means that M/R is maximized and therefore the energy radiated by accretion is very high, corresponding to a very luminous body.



b.	Referring to this same proportion presented in (a) of M/R, we can order the objects in the order in which this proportion is expected to be lowest to highest. In order of compactness (from least to greatest) it goes a sun like star, white dwarf, then neutron star. In terms of mass, a sun like star has one solar mass (as given), white dwarves can range between (approximately) 0.4 -1.4 solar masses (most observed are around 0.5) and the mass of a neutron star is generally between 1 and 3 solar masses (theoretically; highest recorded is around 2.1 solar masses). Considering this, the mass will only affect differences by a factor of about ½ for each star. The main difference between the energy of their luminosities will be their radius. The stars with the smallest radius will produce the biggest luminosities so from smallest to largest energies it would be: sun like star, white dwarf, neutron star. This order will produce the least to greatest luminosities.



c.	Black holes emit in the xray because their emitting area is quite small and their luminosity is large, implying a high flux and thus short wavelength emissions. Because accretion onto white dwarves emit in larger wavelengths, this implies that the temperature must therefore be lower as well to satisfy the Stefan-Boltzmann equation.

1,1,mk2unn@virginia.edu,,Kim,Moses,"Accretion onto black holes can be very luminous. This is because the potential energy lost by matter moving from large radii to small radii is proportional to the mass it’s falling onto and inversely proportional to the final radii. The more compact an object is, the more energy released per unit of mass accreted. Black holes are the most compact objects so they release a lot of energy leading to high luminosities. 

The object with the lowest luminosity would be the Sun-like star. White dwarf would have the next highest luminosity. Then, the neutron star would have the highest luminosity. 

White dwarf accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. Black holes have a large flux which requires high temperatures. High temperature objects emit shorter wavelengths.

1,1,ham9aqv@virginia.edu,,Massie,Harrison,"A)	Black hole accretion produces an incredible degree of luminosity because the energy released is determined by the lost gravitational potential energy of accreted mass. The mass exists at some higher potential, and as it is accreted loses a huge amount potential energy because black holes have such high mass but pretty much no radius. Thus the energy released is comparable to the matter’s rest mass energy.

B)	The neutron star would have the highest luminosity because is most dense, followed by white dwarf, then finally the least luminous accretion would be the sun like star

C)	This implies that they are hotter according to Wien’s law. The difference in emission is due to the incredible forces present in a black holes accretion disk. Matter is acted upon by a huge gravitational force, causing high velocities of gas, friction between gas particles, and a magnetorotational instability that act together to cause the high thermal energy.

1,1,wkn4dm@virginia.edu,,Nehrboss,Will,"As mass falls toward a black hole from some far distance, it loses gravitational potential energy (i.e. it’s gravitational potential energy becomes less negative). The more massive and compact the object the mass is accreting onto the more gravitational potential energy it loses. In fact, if we view the mass as coming from infinity, the amount of gravitational potential energy lost by the accreting matter is (GMm/(2GM/c^2)) = ½ mC^2. This is half the rest mass energy of the object. As this massive amount of energy is lost by the accreting matter, some of it is given off in the form of light. Thus, the compactness of the black hole allows for a massive amount of energy to be radiated from accretion, and accordingly for the black hole to be very luminous. 

Highest to Lowest Luminosities: 

1. Neutron Star (Neutron stars are the most compact objects for their mass of the list, and therefore, the accreting mass would lose the most gravitational potential energy when accreting onto it, yielding the highest luminosity) 

2. White Dwarf (White dwarfs are the second most compact for their mass (supported by electron degeneracy pressure instead of neutron degeneracy pressure) and therefore would have a higher luminosity than a sun-like star but lower than that of a neutron star),

3. Sun-like star. (less compact for its mass, lowest luminosity for reasons above)



The white dwarf must be cooler than black holes. The peak wavelength of emission is inversely proportional to the temperature of the emitting object, thus, because x-rays have a lower wavelength than UV or visible light, white dwarfs must be cooler. 

White dwarfs have a larger higher emitting area relative to their luminosity. This means that they have a lower flux than black holes. Flux is determined by temperature, thus, because white dwarfs have a lower flux, they must also have a lower temperature.

c.Shorter wavelengths in the case of emission mean hotter temperatures so white dwarfs that emit ultraviolet (longer wavelengths than X-rays) would have colder temperatures than a black hole emitting X-rays.

Therefore, the gravitational potential energy lost when falling from a large radius to a small radius is much higher in a black hole compared to something that is larger and less dense. This means that the energy produced by the accretion of an object with mass is higher in a black hole than any other object, making the efficiency higher, making black holes very luminous when they are accreting (more luminous than any other object with the same accretion rate. 



b)From the least luminous to the most luminous, (2) Sun-like star < (1) white dwarf < (3) neutron star. This is simply due to the density. Neutron stars are more compact than white dwarfs which are more compact than a main-sequence star. The gravitational potential energy released as light due to accretion is greatest for the most compact star because the mass to radius ratio M/R is the greatest for the densest objects. 



c)If white dwarf accretion disks emit in the UV/optical range, then their disks are implied to be cooler than those of black holes and neutron stars. (since UV and optical radiation are lower energy than X-ray radiation, so therefore they are generated by a cooler accretion disk). They are most likely cooler because white dwarfs are not as dense as black holes, meaning that the change in potential energy as matter accretes is not as dramatic, meaning it does not get as hot because the luminosity is not as high (F=L/A and F is related to temperature).

Assuming the same accretion rate, the luminosities due to accretion ranked from highest to lowest would be the neutron star, white dwarf, and sun like star. This is because M/R is largest for a neutron star, and lowest for the sun like star.

Because accreting white dwarfs emit optical or ultraviolet light (lower frequency than X-Rays), this suggests they are colder than black holes.

Although black holes have the same gravitational force as other entities with the same mass, the potential energy lost by matter falling onto an object is proportional to its mass and inversely proportional to its radius.

Black holes accretion disks are hotter than white dwarfs because black holes accretion disks have higher flux, meaning they have a greater ratio of luminosity to area.

In order from highest to lowest luminosities, 1. Neutron star 2. White dwarf and 3. Sun-like star.





Optical and ultraviolet light have longer wavelengths than x-rays. This implies that white dwarfs accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks due to Wien’s law which states that the higher the temperature of a body the shorter the wavelength of its maximum radiation. White dwarfs accretion is colder simply due to the fact that white dwarf accretion is not as efficient and thus not as luminous as black holes, meaning it is not as hot.

b) From lowest luminosity to highest luminosity: Sun-like star, white dwarf, neutron star

Therefore, the more compact the object, the more energy is released. 

(b) Most dense - a neutron star, dense- white dwarf, least dense- sun-like star

1,1,skj5fr@virginia.edu,,Jassal,Simrat,"(a)  Referencing gravitational potential energy, explain why sources powered by accretion onto black holes can be so luminous.





	- Accretion is related to the gravitational binding energy. This is represented by the equation for potential energy for accretion of gas by GMm/R where m is the mass and mass M is the object and R is the radius. The energy released is proportional to M/R. By maximizing this ratio we can make the largest change in potential energy by making M as large as possible and R as small as possible. This ratio for the black hole is very big because black holes are compact. The object of black hole they have the smallest possible radius and the event horizon radius is very small. And then this  PE equation for black hole becomes -1/2 mc^2. The gravitational potential energy lost in black hole is comparable to its rest mass energy and half is radiated away as light and the other half is kinetic energy. The efficiency of a black hole is also a lot more compared to the nuclear fusion of the sun where the efficiency is 0.007 for sun whereas non spinning black hole efficiency is around 0.06. This is why sources powered by accretion onto black holes are very luminous. The release of the gravitational potential energy is proportional to the mass radius ratio. The more compact the object, the larger the rest mass energy fraction is released during the accretion. Black holes are very compact for their mass and hence power some of the most luminous objects in the universe. 





(b)  Given your answer to part (a), order the following objects by the luminosity that would be generated by accretion onto them: (1) white dwarf, (2) Sun-like star, and (3) neutron star.  Assume the same accretion rate in each case and clearly indicate which have the lowest and highest luminosities.



Neutron star (highest luminosity) > White dwarf > Sun (lowest luminosity) 

More massive stars are more luminous as luminosity is flux times area and luminosity goes up with increasing mass L ~ M ^ 3.5 and neutron stars are most massive out of these three. 



(c) Accreting white dwarfs are observed to emit most of their light in the optical or ultraviolet, but accreting black holes emit mostly in the X-rays.  Does this imply white dwarfs accretion disks are hotter or colder than black hole accretion disks?  Why might they be hotter or colder?



White dwarf is a star supported against gravity by the electron degeneracy pressure. Degeneracy pressure does not depend on temperature and the white dwarfs are gradually cooling since no new heat is supplied. They are relatively dim but hot and emit in the ultraviolet. Accreting white dwarfs can explote as supernovae and the star is returned to the interstellar medium and no remnant is left. Whereas black holes emit in the X ray due to their large luminosity and small emitting area. Black holes also have a large flux (F = L/A) and require a large temperature so the accretion disk is very hot. The hot objects emit at shorter wavelengths which corresponds to the X-rays.  Since White dwarfs are not that large thus have smaller luminosity they will be colder than the black hole accretion disk. 



The emission from accretion disks is given by the equation L = ηM(dot) c ^ 2. Also since white dward emit in the UV ray, the wavelength is larger than black holes which emit in the X ray. Due to this, we can figure out if the temperature is smaller or larger with the formula Wiens law T = 2.9 * 10^6 divided by the wavelength peak. Since the UV wavelength is greater, we will get a smaller temperature for the white dwarf. ",0,2020-11-20 13:31:22 -0500
1,1,als3px@virginia.edu,,Still,Alix,"a). The release of Gravitational potential energy is proportional to the mass object that it falls into and inversely proportional to its radius. If the object is more compact the larger the fraction of its rest mass energy that is released will be.  

b). Lowest: Sun-like star, White Dwarf, Neutron star :Highest

c). This implies that white dwarfs accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. They are colder since accreting black holes emit x-rays. X-rays have smaller wave legs than UV radiation, there for higher energy than UV rays. ",0,2020-11-20 13:32:56 -0500
1,1,nem4bg@virginia.edu,,Melloni,Nick,"Sources powered by accretion can be as luminous as they are because of the loss of gravitational potential energy. This potential energy released is directly correlated to the mass of the object it is falling into. Since black holes are the densest sources in the universe according to general relativity, this means that the largest possible fraction of rest mass energy is released during accretion.



From highest to lowest luminosities: Neutron star, white dwarf, and lastly sun-like star



Since white dwarfs emit most of their light in the optical or ultraviolet and accreting black holes emit mostly in X-rays, this would imply that black hole accretion disks are hotter. This is because X-rays have a shorter wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum compared to visible light or UV light. Since X-rays have the shorter wavelength it means that they hold more energy which results in a hotter temperature.",0,2020-11-20 13:34:01 -0500
1,1,cgk7uds@virginia.edu,,Kiss,Charlotte,"(a) The largest change in gravitational potential energy comes from making M as large as possible and R as small as possible. The release of GPE is proportional to the mass of the object it falls into and inversely proportional to its radius. Black holes are the most compact sources in the universe for mass, and the more compact an object the larger the fraction of rest mass energy released during accretion. Black hole accretion has high efficiency leading to a large luminosity.

(b) Lowest to Highest: sun-like star (lowest luminosity), white dwarf, neutron star (highest luminosity) 

(c) This implies that white dwarfs accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. White dwarfs emit light in the optical or UV, which have longer wavelengths than x-rays. Light with shorter wavelengths is hotter. ",0,2020-11-20 13:36:22 -0500
1,1,peg9ytk@virginia.edu,,Goldstein,Phillip,"A) Energy released corresponds to gravitational binding energy of accreted matter. The change in potential energy is approximately equal to GMm/R. Energy received per unit mass is proportional to M/R and black holes are compact and extremely massive compared to normal stars, so they are very luminous.



B)Neutron stars have the highest luminosities because they have the highest M/R ratio. White dwarfs are second due to their intermediate mass and low radius. And a sun-like star is third because it is massive but with a high radius. 



C)White dwarfs accretion disks have higher wavelengths (optical or UV) because they have lower energy. Lower energy corresponds to colder accretion disks than Black Holes. The luminosity of black holes is large and the emitting area is small. Because F=L/A, flux is high for black holes. A large flux requires a high temperature according to the Stefan Boltzmann law. Hot objects emit at low wavelengths (x-rays).",0,2020-11-20 13:36:30 -0500
1,1,cms3zd@virginia.edu,,Scruggs,Cris,"a)Potential energy is lost and accreted onto the black hole. The amount of potential energy lost per unit mass accreted is dependent on just how compact the object being accreted onto is. Since black holes are the most compact objects in the universe, potential energy loss is maximized.



b)

1. neutron star (highest)

2. sun like star

3. white dwarf (lowest)



c)White dwarfs must be colder than black holes accretion disks. Black hole accretion disks emit mostly in X-Ray because they’re so luminous for a relatively small emitting area which makes them very energetic and hot. Since x-rays have higher frequency than optical and ultraviolet, it must mean that black holes accretion disks are more energetic and thus hotter.

1,1,cvc2mme@virginia.edu,,Calfee,Carley,"a) The luminosity of accreting black holes is quite large and the emitting area is relatively small by astrophysical standards. Potential energy lost by matter moving from very large radius to very small radius is proportional to the mass it is falling onto and inversely proportional to the final radius. Hence, the more compact an object, the more energy released per unit mass accreted. Black holes are the most compact objects allowed by general relativity.



b) In order of highest to lowest luminosity: neutron star, sun-like star, and white dwarf. Neutron stars are incredibly compact for their mass, whereas the ratio of mass to radius diminishes as one goes from sun-like star to white dwarf. A typical white dwarf can initially be more luminous than an entire galaxy, but because of its small size and rapid cool down, its luminosity is quite low.



c) Yes, white dwarfs are colder than black hole accretion disks. Because of Wein's law, the peak wavelength of emission is equal to 2.9E6 divided by the temperature, meaning that emission wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature. Since a black dwarf has a smaller wavelength of emission, it must have a higher temperature than a white dwarf.",0,2020-11-20 13:37:06 -0500
1,1,sgf2rr@virginia.edu,,Fertig,Seth,"a) Due to the high mass-low radius nature of black holes, matter accreting onto them have high gravitational potential energy. As the matter gets closer to the black hole, its loss in GPE causes a loss in angular momentum, and due to the conservation of energy, the matter must gain energy-- in the form of emitting electromagnetic radiation (light).

b) the luminosity generated by accretion is directly proportional to the object's mass, and inversely proportional to the object's radius. White dwarves have mass similar to our Sun, and radii similar to the Earth. Neutron stars are almost as massive and compact as black holes. So, in order from least luminous to most luminous--

LEAST-> 2 (Sun-like star), 1 (White dwarf), 3 (Neutron star) <-MOST

c) This implies that white dwarf accretion disks are cooler than black hole accretion disks. The temperature of an accretion disk is proportional to the luminosity of the system, and inversely proportional to the emitting area. Since white dwarves cause less of a change in GPE of the accreting matter than a black hole disk, and have a larger emitting area due to their greater radii, white dwarf accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks.",0,2020-11-20 13:37:15 -0500
1,1,arp2ba@virginia.edu,,Parlanti,Alex,"a) The total energy released by accretion is directly related to the object’s gravitational potential energy, whose change is measured by GMm/R. Therefore, a higher mass to radius ratio will increase the energy released by accretion, which in turn leads to a higher luminosity, and black holes are so compact that accretion onto black holes is highly energetic and highly luminous. 

b) lowest luminosity = white dwarf

middle luminosity = Sun-like star

highest luminosity = neutron star

c) This implies white dwarf accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks because hotter objects emit at very short wavelengths, and uv light emits at a higher wavelength than X-rays.

the gravitational field of the black hole. This movement results

in a change (loss) in gravitational potential energy. However, 

due to the conservation of energy, this energy is converted

into velocity to speed up the particle but a large portion

of that energy is converted into bright light. The intensity

of the light is related to the amount of GPE lost which is greatest

when dealing with black holes due to their compactness relative

to their mass.

neutron star, white dwarf, then sun-like star. The order is 

determined based of the mass to radius ratio where the most

massive objects with the smallest radius will be the most 

luminous.





c) This would imply that white dwarfs accretion disks are

in GPE and the lower velocity of accreting particles would

b. Lowest luminosity is sun-like star, then white dwarf, then highest is neutron star.

B.	Most Luminous: White Dwarf, Middle: Neutron Star, Lowest Luminosity: Sun-like Star

C.	White dwarf accretion disks are inferred to be colder than black hole accretion disks. This occurs since black holes attain a large luminosity with a smaller emitting area. On the hand, the white dwarf is more often than not denser, but not as hot. The Stefan-Boltzmann law demands that a large flux is needs a large temperature to emit it so the accretion disk must be hot. White dwarf emit their light in UV or optical. As the wavelength of UV is longer than the X-ray wavelength, it means that the accretion disk of a white dwarf is colder.

b. Lowest to highest: Sun-like star, white dwarf, neutron star



c. The fact that white dwarfs emit most of their light in the optical or ultraviolet implies that white dwarfs accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks.

per unit mass accreted. Black holes are the most compact objects allowed by general relativity.

B) The order would be 3, 2, 1 because Neutron Star were first discovered on the basis of their radio

emission, and they are incredible dense and it has a large luminosity. The Sun-like star has a smaller ratio than the black hole. Lastly, the White dwarfs has a low luminosity due to its size. 

C) The luminosity of accreting black holes is quite large and the emitting area is relatively small by astrophysical standards.  The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that a large flux requires a large temperature to emit it so accretion disk must be very hot. That is why black hole and neutron star accretion disks emit in the X-rays because of their large luminosities and small emitting areas. Therefore, this implies that White dwarfs accretion disks are not hotter than black hole accretion disks because white dwarfs are smaller in size( similar to the Earth)and its luminosity is low due to its size.

1,1,clc6hu@virginia.edu,,Carrington,Charlie,"a) Black holes are the most compact objects allowed by general relativity. Systems with gas accretion onto black holes can be very luminous because the gravitation potential energy lost by matter moving from a very large radius to a very small radius is proportional to the mass it is falling onto and also inversely proportional to the final radius. Thus, the more compact an object, the more energy released per unit of mass accreted. Black holes being the most compact objects allowed by general relativity shows how sources by accretion onto them can be so luminous.

b) Neutron stars are the most compact, so as shown by a), they would have the highest luminosity. White dwarfs are less compact than neutron starts but significantly more compact and dense than sun-like stars, so white dwarfs would have the 2nd highest luminosity while sun-like stars would have the lowest luminosity.

c) The release of gravitational potential energy is proportional to the mass of the object it falls into and inversely proportional to its radius in accretion.

b) The highest luminosity would be generated by a neutron star, the second highest luminosity would be generated by a white dwarf, and the lowest of all of the listed objects would be a sun-like star.

The equation we learned for the change in the potential energy for accretion of gas and mass m onto an object of mass M and radius is about GMm/R. Using this equation we can see that the energy released per unit mass is proportional to M/R, and this ratio is much larger for a black hole due to the fact that black holes are so compact (large mass but small radius), explaining why these sources powered by accretion onto black holes can be so luminous.

Therefore, as the object is more compact, the more energy released per unit of the mass accreted. Because black holes are the most compact sources in the universe, energy that is released, which is the source of the luminosity, can be most luminous sources in the universe. 

b)neutron star is highest, then white dwarf, and sun-like star is the lowest

c)The accretion of white dwarfs is colder than black hole accretion disks. This is because black holes are very compact and are known that the smaller the radius means the deeper it is in the potential well which is where the most energy is released. When you look at the wavelength spectrum, white dwarf ultraviolet light has longer wavelengths which means it produces less energy than the x-rays of the black hole accretion disks have shorter wavelengths which means that there is more thermal radiation and they are hotter.

You look for its gravitational effect on the nearby matter. This can include things such as motion of objects, such as stars and the emission of light. The release of gravitational potential energy is proportional to the mass of the object it falls onto and inversely proportional to its radius. Therefore, the more compact an object is, the larger fraction of its rest mass energy that is released during accretion. And as stated previously, black holes are the most compact sources in the universe for their mass. 



(b) 1-3, lowest to highest. 1. Sun-like star < 2. white dwarf < 3. neutron star



(c) It is colder because if we use Wien's law we see that the wavelength is longer because the ultraviolet wavelengths are longer than x-ray wavelengths . The greater the temperature, the smaller the peak wavelength. X-ray wavelengths are shorter than ultraviolet. And so then white dwarfs are colder.

1,1,sch7amt@virginia.edu,,Harden,Sarah,"a) Black holes are very compact for their mass, which gives them a large M/R ratio. In other words, in addition to a small emitting area, this large M/R ratio causes accreting materials to lose more gravitational potential energy as they fall because they have greater potential energy to begin with (due to the black hole’s large mass) and because fall a longer distance before passing through the event horizon. In the case of a Sun-like star, for instance, because it is less massive and has a bigger radius relative to its mass, the accreted materials don’t have gravitational potential energy initially nor do they lose as much.

b) Assuming the same accretion rate, neutron stars have the highest luminosity out of these three because, like black holes, they are very compact for their mass and have the largest M/R ratio. Second most luminous would be a white dwarf, because it is more compact and has a smaller radius relative to its mass than a Sun-like star. A Sun-like star would have the lowest luminosity.

c) Longer wavelength corresponds with colder temperature. Therefore, white dwarf accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. This is due to the fact that black holes are extremely massive yet small and compact, which gives them greater luminosity and efficiency and causes them to be hotter and emit light with shorter wavelengths. White dwarfs are small, but they are not nearly as massive as black holes, and thus they do not release as much energy.",0,2020-11-20 13:42:03 -0500

The gravitational pull near a black hole is very high meaning the gravitational potential energy of the mass falling onto the black hole will also be very high. When the mass falls the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, and when it hits the black hole, the kinetic energy is released as heat, which translates to luminosity. L = GM/R*dm/dt

c) This implies that the accretion disks in white dwarfs are colder than black hole accretion disks. This could be because their accretion disks are physically larger than black hole accretion disks (or a larger emitting area).",0,2020-11-20 13:42:24 -0500
1,1,ccm3tu@virginia.edu,ccm3tu,McDowell,Caroline,"a. Sources powered by accretion onto black holes can be so luminous because black holes are very compact for their mass. Gravitational potential energy is given by (GMm)/R. M/R gives us the answer for the energy released per unit of mass. If M/R is maximized and made very large, then it can be inferred that it is a black hole because since black holes are so compact, their ratio of M/R is much larger than other stars. Since their M/ R is so large compared to objects with the same mass, they release the most potential energy, making them very luminous.

b. The following objects in order of luminosity from most to least is: neutron star, white dwarf, sun-like star. Neutron stars are the most massive of the 3, so they have the highest accretion rate. white dwarfs are more massive than sun-like stars, so they have a higher luminosity than sun-like stars. Sun-like stars have the least luminosity out of the three. 

c. This implies that white dwarf accretions disk is colder than black hole accretion disks. This is because black holes have very large accretion rates, which means that luminous, but they also have small emitting areas. Since their emitting area is small, which explains they are hot, so they emit their light mostly in the X-rays. Since white dwarfs rely on degeneracy pressure and not thermal pressure, they are known to be colder, since they have a large emitting area and smaller accretion rate. ",0,2020-11-20 13:42:26 -0500
1,1,sc4ct@virginia.edu,868135573,Cho,Soobin,"a) The sources power by accretion onto black holes can be so luminous because the potential energy lost by the matter that has been moving from a large to small radius is proportional to the mass that it is falling onto and inversely proportional to the final radius. Therefore, this shows that the more compact an object is, which a black hole is the most compact, the more energy that is released, meaning that it will be more luminous. 

b) The order of the lowest to highest luminosities would be neutron star to white dwarf to sun-like star (OR neutron star < white dwarf < sun-like star). 

c) Since white dwarfs accretion disks are supported by the degeneracy pressure, it means that they are denser, but not much hotter than black hole accretion disks. Degeneracy simply depends on the density, not the temperature. Therefore, white dwarf accretions disks are colder than the black hole accretion disks. ",0,2020-11-20 13:42:30 -0500

B) 1. White dwarf (Highest) 2. Neuron star 3. Sun-like star (Lowest)



C) This implies that white dwarfs accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. The wavelength of UV rays are longer than those of X-ray, which means the white dwarfs accretion disks are colder.",0,2020-11-20 13:43:31 -0500

(b) neutron star (has the high luminosity), white dwarf, Sun-like star (lowest luminosity)

(c) I think that it does imply that white dwarf accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks because black hole accretion disks finds another companion star to radiate and use materials from which leads to huge release of energy which makes the black hole accretion disk very hot.

1,1,ckg4au@virginia.edu,,Graves,Cabell,"a)Sources powered by accretion of black holes have the ability to be so luminous due to the fact that potential energy is lost by matter moving from a large radius to a small radius is proportional to the mass that it's falling into and inversely proportional to the final radius. Therefore, the more compact the object is, the more energy released per unit mass accreted.

b) Neutron star, sun-like star, and white dwarf (lowest- highest luminosities)

Hence, the more compact an object is, the larger the fraction of its rest mass energy that is released during accretion, and since black holes are the most compact sources in the universe for their mass, they release so much energy during accretion.



b) Least: sun-like star, middle: white dwarf, most: neutron star



c) This implies that white dwarf accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. Because black holes have much more gravitational potential energy, the accretion disks burn off much more matter when falling into the black hole. Because of this, the matter falling in has more energy, emitting in the X-ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum.",0,2020-11-20 13:44:20 -0500

(c) This implies the accretion disks are colder than black holes. This is because the only way for black holes to emit X rays would mean it has to be much hotter. ",0,2020-11-20 13:44:41 -0500

1,1,cel9yft@virginia.edu,cel9yft,Locuratolo,Collin,"(A) Sources powered by accretion onto black holes can be so luminous because as gas from the accretion disk falls into the black hole, it loses some of its gravitational potential energy. However, the rest of the gravitational potential energy is radiated away as light. Now, we must also consider the size and mass of the object the gas accretes into, because the more compact, and smaller the object, the larger the fraction of energy released as light.

The potential energy lost by matter moving from a very large radius to a very small radius is proportional to the mass it is falling onto and inversely proportional to its final radius. Therefore, the more compact the object being fallen onto (i.e. the black hole), the more energy is released by the falling object.



b) In order from highest to lowest luminosity: neutron star, white dwarf, sun-like star. 



c) This implies that white dwarf accretion disks are colder because the equation for wavelength emission is (wavelength)=(2.9*10^6)/T, so the lower the temperature, the longer the emitted wavelength (and UV has a longer wavelength than X-rays).",0,2020-11-20 13:46:06 -0500

b) Neutron, sun-like star and white dwarf



c) This implies that white dwarfs accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. The massive release of energy as matter falls inward towards a black hole makes the disk incredibly hot, so they are clearly hotter than white dwarf accretion disks given they are emitting in the x-rays.",0,2020-11-20 13:46:26 -0500

As gas falls into a black hole, it losses gravitational potential energy which can be radiated as light. That is how it is so luminous.

(b) This all comes down to the accretion efficiency since the formula (which I gave in question (a)) has the constant accretion rate and the constant for the speed of light. So the the efficiency corresponds with the mass of the object. So the highest luminosity would be neutron star, then white dwarf, then Sun-like Star (with the least luminosity)

Because black holes are so compact for their mass, this release of GPE is extremely large. This means that more energy is released per unit mass accreting, making black hole accretion sources so luminous. 

b)	Neutron star -> white dwarf -> sun-like star (from greatest luminosity to smallest luminosity). 

c)	It implies that they are cooler. They are cooler because the wavelength for UV is larger than that of X-ray, and since T = 2.9e6 / lambda peak, the temperature for a white dwarf will be smaller than that of a black hole.

Black holes, having very large mass and small radius have a very large amount of potential energy being released when objects fall towards them. Thus, a very large fraction of an object’s rest mass is released during accretion in the form of light. 



b)

Smaller luminosity = larger radius and smaller mass: 

Larger luminosity = smaller radius and lager mass

Luminosity: (2) sun like star < (1) white dwarf < (3) neutron star



c) Lambda_peak is proportional to 1/T^4, so larger wavelength means colder temperature.

Since accreting white dwarfs’ peak emissions are of larger wavelengths than black hole accretion disks’ peak wavelengths (lambda of visible light or UV > lambda of X-rays), they are colder temperature.

b) From most luminous to least: 1. neutron star, 2. white dwarf, and 3. sun-like star. Based on mass



c) White dwarf accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks because ultraviolet emission has a longer wavelength than X-ray emission (X-rays have shorter wavelengths). Using Wien's Law, the greater the temperature, the shorter the wavelength.

1,1,yj9tr@virginia.edu,,Jeong,Yujin,"a) the sources powered by accretion onto black holes can be so luminous is because the systems with gas accretion onto black holes can be the most luminous sources for their mass in the universe. This is because the potential energy lost by matter moving from large radius to small radius is proportional to the mass it is falling onto and inversely proportional to the final radius. As a result, the more compact the object, the more energy is released 

b)The order would be 3, 2, 1 because Neutron star were first discovered on the basis of their radio emission and they are incredibly dense. Moreover, their large luminosity and the Sun-like star has a smaller ratio than the black hole. also, the white dwafrds has a low luminosity 

c)By astrophysical standards, the luminosity of accreting black holes is large and emitting area is relatively small. Based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, it says that a large flux requires a large temperature to emit it so accretion disk must be very hot. This is why black hole and neutron star accretion disks emit in the X-rays because of their large luminosities and small emitting areas. As a result, this shows that White dwarfs accretion disks are not hotter than black hole accretion disks because white dwarfs are smaller in size and its luminosity is low as well due to its size.

As mass increases, so to does the gravitational effect the stellar body would have on other objects.  This higher gravitational potential factor would induce greater potential energy.  Since black holes are so massive, they would thus store a massive amount of potential energy thus resulting in a greater luminosity.

Black holes emit in the x-ray because very hot objects emit at very short wavelengths, corresponding to x-rays. This implies that white dwarf accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks. The luminosity of accreting black holes is quite large while the emitting area is relatively small which makes the Blackhole have a very large flux, which requires a large temperature.

(b) The object with the lowest luminosity would be the white dwarf. Then, the next object would be the Sun-like star. The object with the highest luminosity would be the neutron star. This is because efficiency is reliant on the compactness, or the density, of the object. Assuming the same accretion rate in each case, neutron stars are significantly denser than Sun-like stars and white dwarfs, and Sun-like stars are denser than white dwarfs.



(c) The fact that accreting white dwarfs emit most of their light in the optical or ultraviolet, while accreting black holes emit mostly in the x-rays, implies that white dwarf accretion disks are colder than black hole accretion disks.

c) L = FA, so the area of the object would have to be significantly greater than that of the Sun for its luminosity to be equal to the Sun's because luminosity is directly proportional to flux and area.
